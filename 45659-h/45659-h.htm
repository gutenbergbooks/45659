<h2>CHAPTER I.<br />

<small>A FIRST NIGHT.</small></h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-i.jpg" width="60" height="60" alt="I" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi">IT was an autumn evening when Molly
Lavender first arrived at Redgarth.
This large school for girls was situated
in a certain well-known district in the
north of England. It adjoined a cathedral town
of great beauty, and was in the neighborhood of
those wide downs and far-reaching moors for
which this part of the country is justly famed.
The school itself was inclosed in spacious
gardens, occupying several acres of land. The
houses of residence surrounded the great hall
and lecture rooms, where the work of education
was carried on. There were eight houses of residence,
and from forty to fifty girls lived in each.</div>

<p>It had been the dream of Molly Lavender's life
to go to Redgarth. Her education hitherto had
been conducted partly at home, and partly in a
small school; she longed to enter a wider world,
and looked forward with much enthusiasm to
the comradeship and <i>esprit de corps</i> which would
form part of the education of her new life. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
vacancy had been offered her at St. Dorothy's,
one of the most popular of the houses, and when
her cab drew up there on this lovely evening, a
very eager and excited young face peeped out.</p>

<p>Molly was fifteen, just the age when girls can
be shy. She had lived in a whirl of excited feeling
during all her long journey from London;
but now that she had really arrived at Redgarth,
a sense of unexpected timidity assailed her, and
although she was not such a coward as to wish
to run away, she heartily desired the first evening
to be well over.</p>

<p>When she appeared, a group of girls were
standing idly chatting in the beautiful entrance-hall.
No one spoke for a moment; but before
there was time for real embarrassment, the
principal of the house, a tall, good-looking,
dignified woman of about thirty, came out of a
room at one side of the hall. She gave Molly a
cordial welcome, introduced her to one or two of
her companions, and then took her upstairs, to
show her her own little room.</p>

<p>"I hope you will be thoroughly happy at
Redgarth, my dear," said Miss Leicester, in her
brisk, energetic voice. "You are very fortunate
in finding a vacancy in this house. We are all
very happy here, and I think I can promise that
you will have a good time. Our motto is, Plenty
of work, and plenty of play; the life is as
healthy and full of pleasure as life can be. For
my part, I envy girls who, like yourself, come to
a great school like this with all their future fresh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
before them. By the way, what is your Christian
name? It is the custom at St. Dorothy's to
call the girls who are in residence by their Christian
names."</p>

<p>"My name is Molly," replied Molly Lavender,
looking, with her clear brown eyes full at Miss
Leicester.</p>

<p>Miss Leicester could not help smiling at the
sweet, frank face. "Molly is a very good name,"
she said; "there is something lovable about it.
I hope you will have a happy time here, Molly.
And now tell me how you like your room."</p>

<p>"Am I to have this room all to myself?"
asked Molly.</p>

<p>"Certainly; how do you like it?"</p>

<p>"I think it lovely&mdash;only&mdash;is it my sitting
room?"</p>

<p>"Sitting room and bedroom in one. Oh, you
don't see your bed! Let me show it to you."</p>

<p>Miss Leicester walked across the little room, to
where a luxurious-looking sofa stood: she pulled
aside a pretty covering, and showed underneath
a properly made-up bed, small, certainly, but
looking most inviting, with its snowy sheets and
white frilled pillows.</p>

<p>"There, Molly," she said, "I hope you will
sleep soundly in that little bed. Your washing
apparatus is cleverly hidden away behind this
screen. This pretty bureau contains a bookcase
on the top, a writing table and desk at one side,
a set of drawers for your linen at the other.
Behind this curtain you will hang up your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
dresses. Now, my dear, I must leave you; but
we shall meet, I hope, at supper time."</p>

<p>Miss Leicester nodded brightly, and the next
moment the tired girl was alone.</p>

<p>"If only Cecil were here!" thought Molly to
herself. "I wonder if there is any chance of
Cecil coming. Oh, yes, this is a sweet little room,
but I feel shy just now. I feel quite stupidly
shy, and like a fish out of water. Still, I'm
determined not to remain in that uncomfortable
position an hour longer than I can help. Grannie
has sent me here, she sent me rather against her
own inclination, and I'm determined to prove to
her that she has done the right and only thing
to satisfy me. I could not live if I didn't make
something of my life. Grannie objects to Girton
and Newnham, but she has consented to my
finishing my education at Redgarth. Now, then,
for a good tussle with the fates; I shall win, I
feel convinced. If only Cecil were here, I should
feel certain on the subject."</p>

<p>Molly took off her hat, brushed the dust carefully
from her dress, rearranged her smooth
brown hair, and washed her face and hands.
Then she went over to the window, threw it open,
and looked out. Redgarth is one of the most
beautiful towns in northern England. It boasts
of a lovely cathedral, and from where Molly
stood she could see its four slender spires, and
its gray turrets, hoary with age. The next
moment the hour struck, and a chime of bells
rang beautifully out on the evening air.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is lovely," thought the girl, clasping her
hands. "I know I shall adore that old cathedral.
How joyous those chimes sound! how
beautiful the evening sky looks at the back of
the spires! Yes, this lovely sunset on my first
arrival is a good omen. I hope, with all my
heart, that I shall do well here."</p>

<p>There came a knock at the door. Molly said
"Come in," and a girl with dark eyes and hair
entered the room.</p>

<p>"My name is Hester Temple," she said. "As
you are quite new, I thought perhaps you would
like to come down to supper with me."</p>

<p>"You are very kind," said Molly, with some
timidity in her voice.</p>

<p>"I hope you like your room," said Hester.</p>

<p>"Yes; I think it charming."</p>

<p>Miss Temple went and stood by the bureau;
she tapped her fingers on its polished surface
somewhat impatiently.</p>

<p>"They all make that sort of remark at first,"
she said; "they all call their rooms charming
until they find out their defects."</p>

<p>"Whom do you mean by they?" asked
Molly.</p>

<p>"The girls at St. Dorothy's. You belong to
'they.'"</p>

<p>"Do I?" said Molly. The color flooded her
cheeks.</p>

<p>Miss Temple regarded her with a fixed and
critical stare.</p>

<p>"I wish you would come here, just for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
moment," she said. "Please stand so, facing
the light."</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Molly.</p>

<p>"Won't you oblige me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, certainly; here I am. Now, what do
you want?"</p>

<p>"To take a good look at you, of course; do
you know you are quite good-looking?"</p>

<p>Molly laughed.</p>

<p>"I wish you would not flatter me, Miss
Temple," she said.</p>

<p>"It is not flattery&mdash;I abhor flattery&mdash;I never
flatter anyone; I am remarked all over the
school for my brusqueness. I simply state a
fact&mdash;a very patent fact; others will tell it to
you in more glowing language. You are good-looking;
you have a clear complexion; not much
color, but that doesn't really matter; your hair
is thick and abundant, awfully prim and old-fashioned
in the way it is arranged, but that can
be altered. I can quite imagine that, if anything
excites you, your face will wake up into
real beauty. Now pray don't begin the usual
thing; don't say, 'Oh, Miss Temple!' or anything
commonplace of that sort. In the first
place, I am not Miss Temple to you&mdash;I am
Hester. We're all Hester, and Jane, and Anne,
and Mary, or whatever our Christian names happen
to be, to each other. What is your name?
Desdemona, I should think; or perhaps
Ophelia&mdash;you've got something of the martyr
droop."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, what a horrid thing to say!" replied
Molly, brisking up and laughing. "I am not
so fortunate as to be distinguished by the name
of either Desdemona or Ophelia: I am simply
Molly."</p>

<p>Hester Temple dropped a mock courtesy.</p>

<p>"Simply Molly," she repeated; "what a dear
little rustic English sound! Well, Molly, I can
read your character already. I see you intend
to go in for the whole thing. You will take up
the life with zest. You will enthuse&mdash;yes, I
know you will. Now, I never do; I don't think
it good form."</p>

<p>"Well, I think it is," said Molly stoutly.</p>

<p>"Didn't I say as much. I knew you had lots
of spirit. How your eyes flash! Oh, you will find
no inconveniences in your room. Everything
will be <i>coleur de rose</i> with you. You are just the
sort of girl whom Miss Forester will adore."</p>

<p>"I am longing to see Miss Forester," said
Molly. "She must be a splendid woman."</p>

<p>Hester shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>"<i>Chacun à son goût.</i> Well, if you are ready,
we had better go downstairs."</p>

<p>"I am quite ready," replied Molly.</p>

<p>The girls left the pretty little room together.
They went down the broad, polished stairs, and
stood for a moment or two in the hall. Molly,
who was not accustomed to the beautiful parquetry
which covered the floor, found herself
slipping about as if on ice. Hester looked at her
and laughed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>"Your first lesson at St. Dorothy's," she said,
"is to get your footing; it is like being on
board ship&mdash;you must get, not your sea legs, but
your parquetry legs. Now, don't be afraid;
don't attempt to walk on your toes&mdash;tread
firmly, and the deed will be accomplished. I
see some of my friends; I will introduce you.
This is Annie Sinclair, and here, here is the romp
of the house, Kate O'Connor. Come here, Kate,
and let me present you to Molly Lavender;
Molly is the new girl we have been expecting,
you know; yes, I quite see that you two will be
chums.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Kate, Kate O'Connor,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Oh, how I love her!"</span><br />
</div>

<p>Hester sang the couplet in a gay, clear voice.
Kate's splendid black eyes danced with mirth.</p>

<p>"I wish you wouldn't be such a ridiculous
creature, Hester," she said, "you would prejudice
anyone against me. Is your name Molly?"
she continued, looking full at the newcomer.
"What a pretty name! I heartily hope you will
have a good time here."</p>

<p>"It is so like you, Kate, to say the word
'heartily,'" exclaimed Hester. "That's because
she is Irish, you know, Molly. Irish girls
always exaggerate. I should consider it quite
sufficient to say, 'I hope you will have a good
time,' but the Irish girl has to put in the word
'heartily.'"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>"I heartily hope you will have a good time,
Molly Lavender," repeated Kate, in a stout
voice.</p>

<p>"It will be her own fault if she hasn't," said
Hester. "What do you say, Annie? What
opinion would you form of a girl who found St.
Dorothy's dull?"</p>

<p>"That she was unworthy of our privileges,"
replied Annie.</p>

<p>"I am most anxious to like everything,"
said Molly.</p>

<p>She laughed slightly as she spoke.</p>

<p>The fact is, she was feeling more nervous than
she dared to own. The girls rattled off their
conversation in brisk, brusque voices; all the
faces were new, all the voices strange; there was
a great deal of badinage and repartee&mdash;a sort of
ceaseless chaff was going on. Molly felt bewildered.</p>

<p>A great gong sounded at this moment through
the house.</p>

<p>"Come and sit near me at supper," said Kate,
noticing the faint alarm which lurked in Molly's
brown eyes. "I will promise to steer you
through the shoals this first evening. You will
get on your own feet in no time."</p>

<p>"No, she won't; she's slipping now," said
Hester, with a laugh.</p>

<p>"Take my arm," said Kate. "This horrible
parquetry! I nearly brained myself during the
first fortnight. Now, here we are; this table to
the left is mine. You must sit here at my right.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
I can't talk to you for the first few minutes, for
I have to carve. Oh, I forgot&mdash;I had better
introduce you before I begin. Girls, this is the
new girl&mdash;Molly Lavender. I'll introduce you
all in correct style presently."</p>

<p>There were five or six tables in the large
dining-hall. All the tables were surrounded by
eager girlish figures. Most of the girls wore
demi-evening dress. Pretty blouses of different
colors were the rage. The principal, Miss Leicester,
looked very handsome in black velvet,
slightly open at the neck. The meal which was
set before the hungry girls was plain but abundant.
Molly, who had not eaten anything for
hours, was glad to turn her attention to the well-filled
plate which Kate placed before her.</p>

<p>"You were lucky not to sit at this table when
Kate O'Connor first took the head of it," said a
laughing girl of the name of Amy Frost.</p>

<p>"Amy, you're surely not going to tell tales?"
cried Kate.</p>

<p>"Yes, I am! yes, I am!"</p>

<p>"Tell, Amy! do tell!" exclaimed several
voices. "Kate deserves to be shown up in her
true colors."</p>

<p>Molly watched the girls as they spoke. Several
pairs of eyes were turned on Kate's laughing,
beaming face. Notwithstanding the badinage in
their tones, the glances which Kate received were
full of affection.</p>

<p>"Oh, she's the wildest, naughtiest, most daring,
most forgetful, wild Irish girl in existence,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
said Amy. "Being Irish, she is full of presumption;
she has the utmost confidence in herself,
and she dearly loves to take the lead. She never
rested until she had persuaded Miss Leicester to
make her head of a table. You perceive, Molly,
that being head means responsibility. The head
has to feed all the hungry members. Well,
when Kate O'Connor first took this honorable
position, she used to indulge in a little peculiarity
of her own. This can only be spoken of as
retiring into her castle in Spain. Kate lives in
her own special castle in Spain most of her time.
Oh, how happy she was in her castle, and how
we suffered! It is not considered correct at St.
Dorothy's to ask the head to feed the members.
The head must think of that for itself. Well,
this head being high up in its castle, forgot all
about us and our hunger, and oh, didn't we
starve, and didn't we growl! It is all over now:
we took her out of her castle in private; we
won't tell you how we did that. Kate, my dear,
you needn't blush; we have forgiven you."</p>

<p>"Beware, Amy; don't add another word,"
interrupted Kate. "Think of the water-jug and
the wet sponge. Remember that you are sleeping
in the dormitory at present, and that my
cubicle is only two doors away from yours. Oh,
I say nothing, but I mean a good deal."</p>

<p>The rest of the meal passed with much mirth
and hilarity. Kate's table was certainly the
merriest in the room. Hester Temple did not
belong to it. Molly did not know if she were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
glad or sorry. Hester puzzled her&mdash;she was not
quite certain whether she liked her or not, but
her whole heart had gone out to Kate O'Connor
on the spot.</p>

<p>When supper came to an end&mdash;and the meal
did not last very long&mdash;the girls all trooped
into the great drawing room. Here a beautiful
square of Indian carpet was hastily rolled up
and an impromptu dance began. Kate opened
a piano and began to play waltzes. The girls
quickly found partners, and were soon revolving
round and round. The barn-dance followed, and
others. Molly could dance beautifully, and Amy
Frost begged to be her partner.</p>

<p>When the dance came to an end a few girls
still lingered in the room, but most went away
to their private studies. Miss Leicester returned
to the drawing room about ten o'clock. She
then led the way into the dining hall, where all
the members of the house, including servants,
stood in rows. The principal read a psalm,
which was followed by a collect; she then bade
her assembled pupils a hearty "good-night."</p>

<p>"Come along, Molly. I was your first friend,
so I will take you back to your room," said
Hester Temple. "By the way, you are lucky to
have a room to yourself. I also have a room,
but it is a very small one. Kate O'Connor, Amy
Frost, Annie Sinclair, and several others sleep in
the big dormitory at the top of the house. I see
you have taken to Kate. Let me give you a hint
as to the way in which you can oblige her."</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>"I should love to oblige her."</p>

<p>Hester laughed.</p>

<p>"Didn't I say you would enthuse?" she
answered. "You might be Irish yourself, by
the way you go on, and by the emphasis you put
upon certain words. You'd love to oblige a girl
you never saw before in the whole course of your
life! Well, poor Kate is ambitious and clever&mdash;indeed,
I may add that in some respects she is
brilliant. She takes up life here from a serious
point of view. There are scholarships given at
Redgarth, and she is studying very hard to
obtain one. The Ford Scholarship is to be competed
for before Christmas. She finds it hard to
prepare for such a serious examination in the
room with a lot of other girls. You might ask
her to be your chum, and to share this dear little
study every evening with you. She'd love you
forever if you did. Kate would rather die than
ask you, but if you will, I'll run up at once and
tell her."</p>

<p>"Oh, I would with pleasure," said Molly,
"only&mdash;only for Cecil."</p>

<p>"Who, in the name of fortune, is Cecil?"</p>

<p>"My greatest, best friend. She is coming
here, I trust and hope, in a week or two."</p>

<p>"Your greatest, best friend!" repeated Hester.
"I give you up, Molly Lavender; your enthusiasm
quite crushes me."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.<br />

<small>THE PRINCIPAL.</small></h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-i.jpg" width="60" height="60" alt="I" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi">IT seemed to Molly that she had only
just dropped off to sleep when she
was awakened by a booming, crashing
sound, which seemed to get upon her
head and half crush her. She rubbed her sleepy
eyes, wondered whether a thunder-storm or
earthquake were taking place, and then suddenly
awoke to the fact that she was a member
of Redgarth School, that she had just spent her
first night at St. Dorothy's, and that this unearthly,
inhuman sound must be the noise made
by the gong, which was telling the girls to arise.
She jumped out of bed, and looked around her
with a momentary sense of dismay. The arrangements
of her complex bedroom puzzled her
not a little. She was just preparing to attack her
washing apparatus, when a low knock came at her
door, and Kate's roguish, laughing face peeped in.</div>

<p>"Are you up? That's right," she said; "you
are sure to long for a nice hot bath after your
journey. Hurry as fast as ever you can to the
bathroom; there is no one in it now. Lock the
door, and have a good splash. Never mind if
the girls come in dozens to turn the handle: first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
come, first served, is the motto here. I got up at
six, and had a glorious cold dip. Now it is your
turn."</p>

<p>"Thank you very much," said Molly, with a
beaming face.</p>

<p>"When you are dressed," continued Kate,
"I'll come and take you down to breakfast.
You don't know any of our daily routine yet, of
course; you shall be under my wing to-day."</p>

<p>Molly gave Kate a beaming look of gratitude.
She then hurried off to the bathroom, had a
good wash, and afterward dressed herself quickly.
As she did so, she could not help rejoicing that
Kate had taken her up.</p>

<p>"I begin to fall in love with her," thought
Molly; "it must be that Irish way of hers. She
is so frank, and her eyes have such a delicious
sparkle in them; then her voice&mdash;it has so many
notes in it. It can be daring, and mischievous,
and mirthful, and tender, and solemn almost in
the same sentence. Yes, I am quite certain that
I shall love Kate very dearly. If Cecil should
not come&mdash;if anything prevents my father doing
what I have begged of him to do, then, perhaps
Kate will be my friend; but oh, of course, I can
never put anyone before Cecil."</p>

<p>Molly was dressed and had put her little
room in order before the second gong, which
was to summon the inmates of St. Dorothy's to
breakfast, sounded through the house. Before
the last boom had quite died away, Kate
appeared.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>"Let us come down at once," she said. "Miss
Leicester has very short prayers in the hall, then
breakfast immediately follows. After breakfast,
those of us who are preparing for lectures are
generally glad to get away by ourselves until it is
time to go to school."</p>

<p>"Please remember that I don't know anything
about anything," answered Molly.</p>

<p>"Well, you will after to-day. Now, here we
are in the dining hall. Good-morning, Miss
Leicester!"</p>

<p>"Good-morning, my dear Kate!" replied Miss
Leicester. "Molly Lavender, dear, I hope you
slept well?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Miss Leicester, I slept beautifully,"
answered Molly.</p>

<p>"Take your stand near Kate. Now, I am
going to begin."</p>

<p>The hall was filled with from forty to fifty
girls of ages varying from seventeen to fourteen.
Miss Leicester stood at the head of the hall. A
troop of servants appeared. The principal read
a psalm; the collect for the day followed; then
the hungry girls marched straight into the breakfast
room.</p>

<p>Molly found herself once again at Kate's
table.</p>

<p>"If you like, you can sit here always," said
Kate to her.</p>

<p>"I should like it very much," answered
Molly.</p>

<p>"All right; I will speak to Miss Leicester.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
Miss Leicester, Molly Lavender would like to
have a seat at my table."</p>

<p>"Is there a vacant place?" asked Miss
Leicester.</p>

<p>"Yes, here to my right."</p>

<p>"Very well, Molly can sit there for the
present."</p>

<p>At this moment Molly met the quizzical eyes
of Hester Temple. Hester's eyes seemed to say,
as plainly as if she spoke the words, "How disgraceful
it is of you to enthuse in that open
manner! I knew you would do it&mdash;I read your
character from the first."</p>

<p>Molly found herself blushing; then a slight
sense of irritation took possession of her
heart.</p>

<p>Breakfast was a meal quickly got over. The
girls were all more or less preoccupied with the
thoughts of the lectures which they were to
attend that morning. Amy Frost, who sat next
to Molly, was quite disconsolate.</p>

<p>"I don't know half my French," she said,
appealing to Kate. "Mlle. Lebrun is so frightfully
strict, and she does gabble so when she
gets excited, that I can't take in half she says.
She was awfully dissatisfied with my last
<i>résumé</i> of her lecture&mdash;she held me up to ridicule
before the other girls. I blush to think
of it even yet."</p>

<p>"Well, Amy, know your French, and you
won't be ridiculed," replied Kate, in a somewhat
tart voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>She was busy pouring out coffee, attending
to the wants of everyone, and giving herself no
thought at all.</p>

<p>"You haven't touched anything," said Molly
at last.</p>

<p>Kate gave her one of her quick, brilliant
smiles.</p>

<p>"It is all right," she answered; her smile
was followed by a sigh. "I am only at the
other end of the pivot," she continued. "I
thought of no one but myself a fortnight ago,
and now I think of everybody except myself.
It is just the reaction, nothing more whatever.
You will soon deplore my selfishness."</p>

<p>"That I'm sure I never shall," answered
Molly, but she felt worried.</p>

<p>"I do wish the girls here would sometimes
talk downright sensible English," she said to
herself. "I suppose the sort of sharp repartee
which goes on all over the place is very clever,
but it certainly puzzles a newcomer like myself.
I wonder how Cecil will like it when she comes.
The girls are not a bit in her style, but they
can't help loving her for all that. She will be
a sort of revelation to them. She is so quaint&mdash;so
unlike anybody else. I wonder when I shall
hear from father. Surely father must say yes.
I think the Indian mails came to London yesterday;
if so, they will be delivered at Redgarth
to-day. Oh, I certainly ought to hear from
father to-day. I wonder what he will have to
tell me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>"A penny for your thoughts, Molly Lavender,"
said Amy, giving Molly's wrist a pinch.</p>

<p>Molly started and blushed.</p>

<p>"I was thinking," she began.</p>

<p>"Anyone could see that. About what?" Amy
asked.</p>

<p>"About my dearest friend."</p>

<p>"For goodness' sake don't answer her when
she says 'a penny for your thoughts,'" interrupted
Kate. "It is shabby of you, Amy, to try
to probe a newcomer. I am head of this table,
and I insist on being obeyed. Girls, will you
stand up, please? I see Miss Leicester is just
about to say grace."</p>

<p>A moment later Molly found herself alone in
the hall. The girls had all rushed off to their
work in different parts of the house. Miss
Leicester, who was passing through the hall
in a hurry, saw Molly standing near the fire.
She paused to speak to her.</p>

<p>"My dear," she said, "prayers are at the
school at a quarter to nine. Don't forget to
ask Kate to introduce you, immediately after
prayers, to Miss Forester."</p>

<p>Molly promised to obey, and then went up to
her room. She found it in the hands of one
of the housemaids. She put on her hat and
jacket, and ran downstairs again. It was a
crisp and beautiful autumn day. Not a leaf
stirred on the trees; the sky was of a clear,
pale blue; there was just a faint touch of frost
in the air.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>"Everything is lovely," she said, under her
breath. "I mean to have a splendid time here.
I mean to show grannie and father of what stuff
I am made."</p>

<p>Her meditations were cut short by a troop
of girls who were seen passing St. Dorothy's.</p>

<p>They stopped abruptly when they saw Molly.
One of them&mdash;a girl with a plain, freckled face&mdash;came
close up to the paling which divided St.
Dorothy's from the rest of the school.</p>

<p>"Say&mdash;are you a newcomer?" she called to
her.</p>

<p>"I don't understand you," answered Molly,
with a little haughtiness.</p>

<p>"But do say&mdash;are you a new-comer?"</p>

<p>When the girl spoke a second time, two or
three of her companions giggled. Molly's face
grew crimson.</p>

<p>"I have just come to St. Dorothy's," she
replied, in a low voice.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear!" The girl with the freckled face
dropped a mock courtesy. "Oh, dear, what a
privilege for St. Dorothy's! I say, girls, isn't it
a prim little darling? Good-by, dearie! we'll
meet very soon in the presence of the great Miss
Forester. <i>Au revoir</i>, love, <i>au revoir</i>."</p>

<p>The girl, with the rest of her companions,
hurried across the grounds, and Molly returned
to her station in the hall. The rest of the St.
Dorothy girls now appeared, dressed in hats and
jackets.</p>

<p>"Come," said Katie, "we are late; we must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
make a rush for it. I promise to steer you
through the shoals. Why, what's the matter?
You look worried."</p>

<p>"I ought not to be," answered Molly, "but
I'm afraid I am. A girl who was passing the
house called out to me in a very disagreeable
voice. Oh, of course I ought not to mind. Is
she a Redgarth girl?"</p>

<p>"Has she sandy hair and a freckled face?"
inquired Kate.</p>

<p>"Yes; she is a plain girl."</p>

<p>"I know her&mdash;her name is Matilda Matthews.
If I were you, Molly, I wouldn't take the least
notice of her. She doesn't belong to our house,
and is never likely to. You'll have little or
nothing to do with her, unless by chance you
happen to attend the same lectures; she can
make herself very disagreeable&mdash;none more so.
I don't believe she is a high-principled girl, and
I should recommend no friend of mine to have
anything to do with her. Of course, you won't,
and she isn't worth a thought. Now, come on;
we must run, or we'll be late."</p>

<p>A moment later, and the girls entered the wide
quadrangle of the school. They entered the
enormous hall, where four hundred girls were
assembled for prayers. Molly, to her joy, found
her place by Kate's side, and after a moment of
dazed wonder, had courage to raise her brown
eyes to look around her. Hundreds of other
eyes seemed to meet hers. In multitudes, however,
is safety. Molly could not be afraid of all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
the eyes. Soon a voice at the other end of the
hall arrested her attention. She saw a solitary
figure standing on a platform. The figure was
that of a tall and noble-looking woman in the
prime of life. There was a look about the whole
face which immediately arrested the attention of
those who gazed at it. The eyes had a kindling
light in them, the mouth was shrewd as well as
kindly, the brow was very full, broad, and of
noble proportion; but it was the voice which
awoke that quick enthusiasm with which Molly
herself was full.</p>

<p>"That is Miss Forester, the principal of the
school," whispered Kate to her companion.</p>

<p>Molly nodded; she could scarcely take her
eyes from Miss Forester's face.</p>

<p>The principal gave out the first line of a hymn.
A few bars were played on an organ, and then
the whole of the great hall became full of the
sweetest and most trained melody. The girls
sang in parts: the music was simple, but beautifully
rendered.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"At thy feet, O Lord, we lay,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Thine own gift of this new day,"</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>sang the four hundred girls.</div>

<p>Molly found herself entering into the spirit of
the well-known words. Toward the end of the
hymn tears very nearly choked her voice. She
was just the sort of girl to be easily influenced
by her present surroundings. The hymn was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
followed by a psalm, which Miss Forester read
aloud in her deep and beautiful tones. A second
hymn followed; then there came a short prayer,
followed by the benediction.</p>

<p>Immediately afterward all was bustle and
movement. Miss Forester held up her hand.
The girls and teachers stood still, as if by magic.</p>

<p>"I will take the class for Scripture in the
north room in five minutes," said the principal.
"Now, file out in order, please; every girl to
her class."</p>

<p>The girls and teachers began to move up the
hall.</p>

<p>"Stay behind one moment, Molly," said Kate;
"I will take you to Miss Forester."</p>

<p>As she spoke Kate led Molly to the upper end
of the hall. Miss Forester stood erect and dignified
on the platform. It was very evident that
her dark eyes took in each particular of the
whole scene. Mistresses and pupils alike were
all under her domination. Suddenly her eyes
fell upon Kate.</p>

<p>With an imperious wave of her hand she
beckoned the young girl to her side.</p>

<p>"Tell me why you are not going to your class,
Kate O'Connor?" was her query.</p>

<p>"If you please, Miss Forester, I have brought
Molly Lavender here."</p>

<p>"And who is Molly Lavender?"</p>

<p>"She is the new girl at St. Dorothy's."</p>

<p>"Yes, of course, I remember. Tell her to
come here."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>Kate beckoned to Molly, who came up at once.</p>

<p>"How do you do?" said Miss Forester, looking
at the young girl as if she would read her
through.</p>

<p>Molly raised her eyes to the principal's face.
Something in their earnest gaze kindled an
answering light in Miss Forester's eyes.</p>

<p>"I hope, Molly Lavender," she said, "you
have come to this school imbued with an earnest
spirit, and a desire to avail yourself of the great
advantages which will be offered you?"</p>

<p>"I trust I have, madam," replied Molly, lowering
her eyes.</p>

<p>There was something in the expression of the
sweet face which touched the principal. She
laid her firm hand for a brief instant on Molly's
shoulder.</p>

<p>"If that is the case, my child, you will do
well," she replied, in a gentle but thrilling voice.
"Thank you, Kate, you can now attend to your
own work. Molly, you have found no niche as
yet. You can come with me to the north room;
afterward I will take you to see the different
professors, in order to ascertain what classes you
are best fitted to join."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.<br />

<small>PROFESSORS AND PUPILS.</small></h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-m.jpg" width="59" height="60" alt="M" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi3">MOLLY was destined all her life long to
remember the lecture which the principal
of Redgarth delivered to her class
that morning. The simplicity of the
words, the noble thought which pervaded each
utterance, penetrated straight to her sensitive
nature. Molly was in just the mood to be uplifted.
She was the sort of girl to take things
seriously. She regarded her arrival at Redgarth
as a great step in her career. When Miss
Forester spoke to her as she did, she struck
the right chord, and whatever the future might
bring forth, Molly became strongly attached to
the principal from the first.</div>

<p>Miss Forester, who was quick at reading
character, could not but be interested in those
speaking and pathetic brown eyes. Now and
then she gave her new pupil a full and direct
glance. Molly bore this without shrinking; she
was no longer shy; she was so completely interested
that she forgot herself.</p>

<p>The lecture was on "The Value of Personal
Influence." Miss Forester spoke much about
the direct influence which each girl, however
young, or slight, or commonplace, exercised over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
her companions; she touched on the all-important
subject of environment, and said that those
girls who had the privilege of being educated at
a school like Redgarth would have much to
answer for in the future. Molly made many
brave resolves as she listened to the spirited
words.</p>

<p>When the class was over Miss Forester took
her new pupil through the school, introduced
her to many of the professors, and showed, by
her manner, that she already took a marked and
special interest in her.</p>

<p>"I will enter your name for my Scripture
class at once," she said. "I saw you were
interested in what I said this morning."</p>

<p>"Yes, madam," answered Molly.</p>

<p>"I have not time to talk to you much now;
you must come to my study some evening for a
long chat; but just tell me what special branch
of study you wish to take up. Is it your intention
to go from here to Girton or Newnham?"</p>

<p>"I should like to, but I shall not be able,"
answered Molly.</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"My father does not wish it; he wants me to
join him in India when I am eighteen."</p>

<p>"I see&mdash;I see! Then we must make you
a specially useful and practical girl. Is your
mother living?"</p>

<p>"No." Molly lowered her eyes, a faint pink
color stole into her cheeks.</p>

<p>"Then you are a motherless girl," said Miss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
Forester kindly. "I always have a special
leaning toward such. I was motherless myself
when very young. If your mother was a good
woman, as I am sure she was, you must try to
live up to what she would expect from you,
could she speak to you from the home where she
now is. There is a great deal to be done in life:
I must not enter on this subject now. May I ask
you a question? Is your father well off?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Molly; "he is an Indian
judge. He tells me that when I go to him I
shall have to look after a very large establishment."</p>

<p>"Precisely; then you must learn how to rule.
You must also know how to use your hands in
the most efficient and thorough way possible. I
approve of a course of training in cookery, and
also in all branches of housework. Know something
of the work that you try to correct in your
household staff. You must also learn to rule
your spirit. All this knowledge is a great and
wonderful possession. Now I must talk no
more. I am going to ask Miss Shaw to take you
in hand for English. Here she is&mdash;let me introduce
you to her."</p>

<p>Miss Shaw, a tall, somewhat gaunt woman,
with an enormous brow, and clear but light blue
eyes, came up to Miss Forester at this moment.</p>

<p>"Let me introduce Molly Lavender," said
Miss Forester. "She has only just arrived at
Redgarth, and is one of the new residents at St.
Dorothy's. Will you kindly examine her in her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
English studies some time this afternoon? I
know nothing with regard to her attainments,
but at least she can think. I wish Molly to have
every possible advantage, Miss Shaw; and if
you think she is capable of understanding your
lectures, will you take her as one of your
pupils?"</p>

<p>"With pleasure," replied Miss Shaw. "Come
with me now, Molly; I am giving a course of
lectures at this hour on 'Moral Science.' Here
is a notebook for you; you can make any notes
you like. If the subject is new to you, you will
find it a little difficult at first, but just note down
anything you understand. Immediately afterward
I shall lecture on Charles I., which will
probably be a more interesting subject. Will
you return this afternoon at two o'clock? We
can then have a quarter of an hour together, and
I will find out what you really know, and what
you don't know. Now, this is your seat, my
dear."</p>

<p>Molly seated herself in front of a small desk:
the desk contained ink, pen, and blotting-pad.
Her new, clean, little notebook lay before her.
The professor immediately resumed her place
on a small platform, and continued her lecture.
The subject was decidedly over Molly's head,
but she made valiant efforts to attend and
understand. She was getting some faint ideas
with regard to one of the primary rules of the
subject of the lecture, when a sudden and severe
dig in her elbow caused her to turn her head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
abruptly. The sandy-haired girl was seated
next to her. She gave Molly a particularly
intelligent glance, accompanied by a knowing
wink. Molly turned away; her irritation and
dislike were quite apparent.</p>

<p>The lecture lasted for half an hour. Immediately
afterward those girls who were attending
the English History class followed Miss Shaw
into another room.</p>

<p>"Molly Lavender, will you come with the
rest?" said Miss Shaw, giving her new pupil
a kind smile.</p>

<p>"Say, is Molly Lavender the little name?"
whispered the sandy-haired girl. "Ha, ha!
Miss Prim, didn't I tell you we'd soon meet
again? Your little secret is divulged. Molly
<i>Lavender</i>, forsooth! Dear me, I wonder if it
smells sweetly." She caught one of Molly's
hands as she spoke, and raised it to her nostrils.</p>

<p>Remembering Kate O'Connor's advice, Molly
resolved to take no notice. There were certain
forms of ridicule, however, which affected her
painfully, and she had some difficulty in keeping
back a strong sense of anger. Without
making any reply, she hurried after the rest of
her companions to the English History classroom.
To her great relief, she found that
Matilda Matthews was not one of the number.
With Charles I. and his pathetic story Molly
found herself quite at home. Miss Shaw was
a splendid lecturer, and she threw many fresh,
lights on that time of struggle and adversity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
Molly listened so hard that she scarcely put
down any notes. The girl who was seated
next to her spoke to her on the subject.</p>

<p>"You will forgive me, won't you?" she said.
"You are a stranger here, are you not?"</p>

<p>"Yes; this is my first day at school. Why
did you ask?"</p>

<p>"In the first place, your face is new, and in
the next, you hardly took any notes. You
ought to take plenty of notes. You will be expected
to show a perfect <i>résumé</i> of this lecture
to-morrow morning to Miss Shaw."</p>

<p>"I can easily do that," answered Molly.
"I remember almost every word."</p>

<p>"You think so," said the girl, "but you will
find, when you begin to write, that that is not
the case. Please take my advice, and make
plenty of notes in future. You will find that
the most salient facts have slipped your
memory. Miss Shaw wants accuracy beyond
everything. Your writing, your spelling, your
grammar, must all be perfect. Miss Shaw will
be down on you like a sledge-hammer if you
make a mistake. Then Miss Forester reads
almost all the <i>résumés</i> of the lectures in the
course of the week. I never knew anyone so
strict as Miss Forester. She aims at perfection
herself, and woe betide any of us, if we try to
fall short of her ideal! Now this morning's
work is over, and we are all going to your different
houses for dinner. Where do you live?"</p>

<p>"At St. Dorothy's."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>"Lucky you! there isn't a house in the place
like St. Dorothy's. I'm at Orchard House.
Oh, yes, it's very nice, and we have a splendid
garden, but St. Dorothy's is <i>the</i> place of residence.
Have you a room to yourself?"</p>

<p>"Yes; a tiny one."</p>

<p>"Lucky you again! I have the fourth of a
room; the room is divided by curtains; all the
furniture is the same color,&mdash;Miss Marsden is
the name of our principal&mdash;that is her special
fad. I am in the golden room. It is so pretty:
wall-paper, chintzes, bed hangings, curtains, all
of a pale shade of gold. The blue room is next
to that; then we have the green room; then the
red room; then the violet room. I must say
they are all sweet, but a room to one's self is
something to be coveted. What is your name?"</p>

<p>"Molly Lavender."</p>

<p>"How pretty! I once had a sister called
Molly; she died; you've a certain look that
reminds me of her. My name is Constance
Moore; I'm studying awfully hard; I've got to
live by it some day. I'm so glad we are going to
sit next to each other at history. Now, be sure
to take notes this afternoon. Good-by, Molly!
Ah, there is Kate O'Connor; she is calling you to
walk home with her."</p>

<p>In the afternoon Molly had an interview with
Miss Shaw, and one or two other professors, who
wished to ascertain what her abilities and acquirements
were. Molly's intellectual powers
belonged essentially to the average order. Her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
force of character, however, and intensely warm
heart, gave her a marked individuality wherever
she went. She spent an afternoon of hard work,
and returned to tea at St. Dorothy's, feeling tired
and overexcited. Kate O'Connor, who was
standing in the entrance hall, slipped her hand
through Molly's arm, and they walked together
to the tea-room.</p>

<p>"Well," she said, in a sympathetic tone,
"how did you get on? You had an ordeal to go
through, had you not?"</p>

<p>"I got on pretty well," answered Molly; "I
am not a bit clever, you know."</p>

<p>Kate glanced at her with a smile.</p>

<p>"Perhaps not," she replied. "What does
that matter? You are going to be a very sweet
woman by and by; you are going to be womanly
in the best sense of the word. Miss Forester has
taken quite a fancy to you&mdash;that in itself is
something to be proud of; she scarcely ever
shows preference. When she does, that person
is in rare luck, as we say in old Ireland. But
what have you done? Whose lectures are you
to attend?"</p>

<p>"Miss Shaw is going to take me for English,
Mlle. Lebrun for French, then I am to join Professor
Franklin's class for drawing, and Fräulein
Goldschmidt will undertake my music."</p>

<p>"I think you have done very well," replied
Kate; "but don't you want to take up something
special? Are you only going in for an all-round
education?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>"Miss Forester spoke to me about that,"
answered Molly, blushing slightly. "She says
my attainments are quite average; I am neither
beyond nor behind the ordinary girl of my age.
She recommends me strongly to give a year to
general education. At the end of that time she
will counsel me with regard to any of the special
subjects which I am likely to wish to take up.
My father is devoted to music, but I don't think
I have it in me to make a first-rate musician,
although my late mistress said that my voice was
true."</p>

<p>"If it is, you had better take singing lessons,
Molly. A sweet, true voice can give a great deal
of pleasure."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know it makes other people happy,
which is a great deal to be said in its favor,"
replied Molly; "but, really, I can do very little in
that way."</p>

<p>"You shall sing to me; Hester Temple has a
piano in her room. You shall sing to me there."</p>

<p>"I could not sing before her."</p>

<p>"Forgive me, that is silly of you. Hester is a
most excellent creature, although I grant she is
a trifle quizzical. Rest assured, however, that
she has plenty of heart beneath it all. I hope,
Molly, you are not going to be too modest; that
is a great mistake. Now, I am not going to lecture
you any more. By the way, there is a letter
for you. It came by the midday post. It was
lying on this slab, where all the letters are put,
and I said to myself, 'Molly Lavender shall not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
be quizzed.' You know some of the girls quiz
a newcomer shamefully. I put the letter in your
room; you will be able to read it in peace
now."</p>

<p>"Thank you a thousand times," replied Molly,
the color spreading all over her delicate face.
"Did you, Kate, happen to notice if the letter
had a foreign stamp upon it?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I didn't. Now we must really go
into the tea-room. Miss Leicester likes us to be
punctual."</p>

<p>After tea, the girls strolled about the grounds
in pairs, chatting, and eagerly recounting the
different events of the day. The girls of Redgarth
formed a little world of their own, and
Molly began already to see that, notwithstanding
the really splendid life of the place, their views
were somewhat narrow, and seldom extended
beyond the surroundings of the school. On this
occasion, she had little leisure to give to them;
her one desire was to get away to her room, in
order to be able to read her earnestly expected
letter.</p>

<p>Kate helped her in this.</p>

<p>"You can't have half unpacked," she said.
"You will have nice time to put all your things
in order between now and supper; run off and
do it, and pray remember this is your last evening
of leisure. You will have to write <i>résumés</i>
of all your lectures to-morrow night, and won't,
for the next week or fortnight, have time or
thoughts to give to anything but your studies."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>"And will it be better after the first week or
fortnight?" asked Molly.</p>

<p>Kate laughed.</p>

<p>"It may take longer than that," she replied;
"the whole thing depends upon yourself. If
you are quick and adaptable, you will soon get
into the ways of the place. You will begin to
understand the professors, and to know that
mademoiselle wishes to have one thing remembered,
fräulein another, Miss Shaw another.
You will begin, in short, to classify, and to make
the sort of notes which will be useful to you;
but for the first fortnight or three weeks, I may
as well tell you at once that you will be in hopeless
hot water over your notes."</p>

<p>"Oh, Kate, you quite frighten me!" exclaimed
Molly.</p>

<p>"I am sorry, but I must tell you the truth.
Isn't it so, Hester?" she called out.</p>

<p>Hester, who was passing through the hall,
came up to Kate's side.</p>

<p>"Is what true?" she said, with a laugh.</p>

<p>"Isn't it true that poor Molly will be in hot
water over her notes?"</p>

<p>"Hotter than hot&mdash;scalding, I should say,"
replied Hester.</p>

<p>"Now I am sure you are not in earnest,"
answered Molly.</p>

<p>"Oh, am I not? I never more fully and absolutely
spoke the words of sober wisdom. May I
ask if you attended a lecture to-day?"</p>

<p>"I listened to two of Miss Shaw's lectures&mdash;one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
on 'Moral Science,' which I did not understand."</p>

<p>"I should rather think not, poor chicken!
What has a baby like you to do with moral
science?"</p>

<p>"I didn't understand it a bit," answered
Molly; "but afterward Miss Shaw lectured on
Charles I., and what she said was quite splendidly
interesting."</p>

<p>"So interesting that you enthused&mdash;<i>n'est ce
pas?</i>"</p>

<p>"Please don't quiz me, Hester; I was deeply
interested in that lecture."</p>

<p>"You took notes, of course?"</p>

<p>"I didn't&mdash;at least very few."</p>

<p>"And you are to write a <i>résumé</i> of the lecture
to-night?"</p>

<p>"I am; but it really won't be difficult."</p>

<p>"All right. Now, Kate, do let me speak!
Molly, my dear, there is no teacher like experience.
Write your notes by all means, then tell
me to-morrow evening what Miss Shaw thought
of the <i>résumé</i>. Now, I see you are dying to put
your things in order. Be off with you!"</p>

<p>Molly ran upstairs; she was excited, her new
life was full of the deepest pleasure, but there
were a few qualms lying near her heart. Suppose,
after all, she failed to grasp the full meaning
of this beautiful home of learning. Suppose
she didn't avail herself of the advantages held
out to her. She had struggled so hard to come
to Redgarth: suppose it was a mistake, after all.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
She knew well that she was not specially clever
or brilliant in any way.</p>

<p>"I don't want to fail," thought Molly. "Oh,
how I wish Cecil were here! she would help me
so much. Yes, here is father's letter at last.
Now, I wonder what he has said. Am I to be
made happy? Is Cecil's life to be a grand success,
or the reverse? Oh, dear! I quite tremble at
the thought of what the next few minutes may
bring forth."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.<br />

<small>DWELLERS IN CUBICLES.</small></h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-m.jpg" width="59" height="60" alt="M" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi4">"MY dear Molly," wrote her father, "when
this reaches you, you will have begun
your new life us a student at Redgarth.
From what your grandmother tells me,
I am sure the place will suit you, and I trust
you will derive all possible benefit from the
sound education which you are receiving. I may
as well, however, say frankly that, for my own
part, I don't especially care for learned women.
I like a girl to be thoroughly well domesticated,
and to think no household work beneath her
knowledge. When you come to me, you will
have a great deal to do in the way of superintending&mdash;you
will be the mistress of a large staff
of servants; you will have to contend against
the prejudices of race, and the ignorance of the
Hindu. I differ from most of my countrymen
in disliking the style of cooking which goes on
here. I have no passion for curries, and curry
seems to be the sole thing which the Indian cook
considers necessary to digestion. I hope, Molly,
you have a taste for cooking. Does Miss Forester
happen to have a class for the training of
young girls in this important department? If
so, I beseech you, my child, join it. I quite long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
for a few dishes in the old-fashioned English
style."</div>

<p>"Oh, when will he come to the point?"
thought poor Molly, as her eyes rushed over the
page.</p>

<p>His honor, Judge Lavender, however, had by
no means exhausted himself on the all-important
subject of dinner.</p>

<p>"You know, of old, my love, that I am easily
pleased," he continued. "A little clear soup
nicely flavored, a cutlet done to a turn, with the
correct sauce,&mdash;understand, Molly, that everything
depends on the sauce,&mdash;a savory omelette,
a <i>meringue</i> or a jelly, make up the simple dinner
which more than satisfies your affectionate father.
You will think of this trifling matter, my darling,
when you are perusing your Latin and Greek,
and those other abstruse subjects which are now
considered essential to the feminine mind."</p>

<p>"What would father think if he saw me
puzzling my brains over 'Moral Science'?"
thought Molly, knitting her dark brows. "Oh,
dear, dear! I'm afraid he's got this cooking craze
so strong on him at the present moment that he
will forget all about my darling Cecil."</p>

<p>She bent her head and continued to read her
letter.</p>

<p>"Yes, I am enjoying excellent health; all the
delicacy from which I suffered some years ago
has passed away. I am a hale and strong man,
and do not feel any inconvenience from this
climate. I shall be able to place you in a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
nice position when you take the head of my
house, my dear little girl. Prepare for this time
now by all the means in your power; work hard,
eat plenty, take abundance of exercise, and come
out to me in two years' time a fresh and beautiful
specimen of young English girlhood. I shall
look forward to your first impressions of Redgarth
with much interest. From what your
grandmother tells me, Miss Forester must be a
remarkable woman. I only trust she is not too
mannish. Whatever you do, Molly, strive to
retain all the gentle privileges of your sex.
Endeavor to polish yourself in every way, my
love, and to acquire those nice accomplishments
which are essential to the comfort of man. I
want you to be particular about your dress.
Your dear mother was. I would not have
married her if this had not been the case."</p>

<p>"Oh, I wish he wouldn't drag darling mother's
name in," thought Molly, her lips quivering.
"Why do his letters, although I long so for
them, always set my teeth on edge?"</p>

<p>"I want you to learn grace and deportment,
my darling," continued Judge Lavender; "in
particular, how to enter and leave a room nicely.
A little light repartee, not <i>too</i> clever, in conversation,
gives sparkle, and is by no means amiss.
For Heaven's sake, don't ever consider that it is
your duty to argue with men: just let them see
that you understand them; they like to be
appreciated. Above all, learn the art of making
tea gracefully, and without any <i>contretemps</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
Deportment is fearfully overlooked, in these later
days of our century. Struggle for a dignified
deportment, Molly, as you love me. Now I must
stop, my dear, or I shall miss the post.</p>

<div class='sig'>
<span style="margin-right: 4em;">"Your affectionate father,</span><br />
"<span class="smcap">Charles Lavender</span>."<br />
</div>

<p>"Oh, good gracious! not a single word about
Cecil," thought poor Molly. "Yes, yes, here's
a postscript; her name does come in&mdash;now, what
does he say?"</p>

<p>"As to your erratic and eccentric young
friend, Cecil Ross, I own that I feel a certain
difficulty with regard to the request which you
have made. I am quite rich enough to oblige
you in the matter as far as mere money is concerned;
my difficulty is on quite another head.
The fact is, I dread the influence this exceedingly
brusque young person may bring to bear on your
own character, and hesitate, therefore, at the
thought of placing her at the same school."</p>

<p>"Oh, father! how can you!" thought Molly,
quick tears filling her eyes. "Oh, my darling,
noble, brave Cecil! How little you know her!"</p>

<p>"I don't absolutely refuse your request, my
dear," continued the judge, "but before granting
it, I have written to your grandmother to
consult her on the subject. She will give me an
unprejudiced report with regard to Cecil Ross.
When I hear from her I will reply to you. Now,
once again, adieu. Your affectionate father."</p>

<p>After finishing her letter, Molly became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
oppressed by a strange sense of limpness. The
strength and go which her vigorous day had
imparted seemed suddenly to forsake her. She
clasped her hands on her lap and gazed straight
before her. She had been indulging in a daydream,
and the letter which she had just received
from the one whom she loved best in the world,
gave her a sense of chill which almost amounted
to shock. Tears rose slowly to her eyes; she
slipped the letter into her pocket, and going
over to her little writing-table, took a sheet out
of her portfolio, and wrote a few hasty lines
to her grandmother.</p>

<p>"I have scarcely time for more than a word,"
wrote Molly. "I have just heard from father,
who wants to consult you about Cecil. Please,
darling grannie, tell him what you really think of
Cecil. Oh, I know she will be quite safe in your
hands. Please do not lose a mail in writing to
father, for the whole thing is so important.</p>

<div class='sig'>
<span style="margin-right: 2em;">"Your loving and anxious</span><br />
"<span class="smcap">Molly</span>."<br />
</div>

<p>Having finished the letter, Molly addressed it;
she then ran quickly downstairs, to discover by
what means she could get it into the post. Miss
Leicester met, her in the hall.</p>

<p>"Well, Molly," she said, in a cheerful tone,
"I hope you have by this time got all your
things nicely unpacked and in perfect order, so
as to be able to get into a good routine of work
to-morrow."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am ever so sorry," answered Molly, "but
the fact is&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What, my dear; why do you hesitate?"</p>

<p>"My things are not unpacked, Miss Leicester.
I had a long letter from father by this afternoon's
post; I have been reading it; there was
a good deal in the letter to make me think; then
it was absolutely necessary for me to write this.
Please tell me where I am to put this letter in
order that it may be posted."</p>

<p>"In the box just above your head which is
marked 'Letters.' I am sorry to say you are
late for this evening's departure."</p>

<p>"Am I really? Oh, what a pity! When will
the letter go?"</p>

<p>"This box will be cleared the last thing to-night,
and the letter will reach London, if London
is its destination, some time to-morrow afternoon.
I am sorry your things are not unpacked;
all your time after supper ought to be taken
up preparing for to-morrow's work. Miss Shaw
tells me that you are to write notes on two
lectures which she delivered this morning. Let
me tell you, Molly, that Miss Shaw is extremely
particular. Well, I suppose I must excuse you
this time, but now run off, my love; don't waste
a moment."</p>

<p>Molly ran upstairs; the cloud which her
father's letter brought over her spirit seemed to
grow a little thicker.</p>

<p>"No one quite understands me except Cecil,"
she muttered. "How I wish Cecil were here!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>She stooped over her trunks and began unpacking
them. The occupation did her good, and
brought back some of her cheerfulness. She had
nearly come to the end of her task when the
great gong for supper sounded through the
house. She found that she had no time to
change her dress; Miss Leicester always insisted
upon punctuality at meals, and Molly would be
forced to appear in her thick morning dress. She
hastily smoothed her hair, and went downstairs
feeling hot and uncomfortable. Every other girl
at Kate O'Connor's table looked cool and fresh.</p>

<p>"Come and sit near me, Molly," said Kate, in
her kind voice. "After supper," she whispered,
as Molly sank down into the vacant chair, "I
have a little plan to talk over with you and Amy
Frost. You must both come and see me in my
dormitory."</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Molly.</p>

<p>"I am not fortunate like you," answered
Kate; "I can only receive you in my share of
the dormitory. Oh, I don't complain of my little
cubicle, but a cubicle is very different from a
room."</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Molly, in a reflective tone.
She thought that Kate's eyes were fixed upon
her with an expectant and wistful glance.</p>

<p>She longed to ask her to chum with her in
her own pretty room, but the thought of Cecil
restrained her.</p>

<p>"Do you find the room very hot?" asked Amy
Frost's voice at her elbow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>Molly, who was flushed already, grew redder
than ever.</p>

<p>"I suppose I look very hot," she replied; "I
forgot all about changing my dress, I was so
busy unpacking."</p>

<p>"Unpacking from tea to supper time!"
responded Amy. "What a lot of dresses you
must have brought!"</p>

<p>"Don't be impertinent, Amy," said Kate.</p>

<p>"My dear Kitty, that is the last thing I wish
to be, but patent facts must draw forth certain
conclusions. If Molly has not come here with a
supply of luggage resembling a trousseau, why
should she take from half-past four to seven
o'clock to get her things in order?"</p>

<p>"I didn't," said Molly; "I was reading a
letter and writing one."</p>

<p>She spoke defiantly. Her manner irritated
Amy, who had not the best temper in the world.
She didn't speak at all for a moment; then,
bending forward, she said, in a semi-whisper:</p>

<p>"I hope you will forgive the remark I am
going to make. I do it as a matter of duty. It
is the duty of old girls to give newcomers all
possible hints with regard to deportment, the
rules of the place, etc. Now, Miss Leicester is
an angel, but she is an angel who likes us all to
observe the unspoken rules of the house. One
of these is that we should look nice and fresh at
supper time. Those who do not carry out her
wishes are likely to get into her black books.
Now, there is a difference, a subtle difference,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
between the white and black books even of an
angel. Take the hint, Miss Lavender. I have
spoken."</p>

<p>"I don't think you have spoken at all nicely,
Amy," said Kate. "Why do you persecute
poor Molly? Of course she'll come downstairs
properly dressed to-morrow night."</p>

<p>"Have I made you angry?" asked Amy, looking
hard at her.</p>

<p>"No, no!" replied Molly. She felt tears near
her eyes, but made an effort to recover herself.
"The fact is," she said, making an effort to
speak pleasantly, "I knew perfectly well that
I ought to dress for supper. Hester was kind
enough to tell me all about it last night, but I
had a long letter from father. This letter interested
me very much. I was obliged, in consequence
of it, to write a hasty line to my grandmother
in London. The rest of my time was
spent unpacking my things, and I found, when
the supper gong sounded, that I was still in
my morning dress. That is the whole story.
If, on account of this omission, I am likely to
displease Miss Leicester, I had better go and
apologize after supper."</p>

<p>"Oh, for goodness' sake, don't do anything of
the kind!" said Amy. "Twenty to one Miss
Leicester has never noticed you. Molly, your
generous explanation forces me to confess my
fault. I am the soul of mischief&mdash;in short, I am
the Puck of St. Dorothy's. Your hot face, and
a certain little air of discomfort which it expressed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
tempted me to quiz you. Now, do forgive
me, and think no more of the matter."</p>

<p>"I am glad you have said that, Amy," exclaimed
Kate, in a pleased tone. "Don't forget
that you are to come up to the dormitory with
Molly after supper."</p>

<p>The meal had come to an end, and as no one
seemed inclined to dance that night, Molly soon
found herself an inmate of Kate's pretty cubicle.
The dormitory consisted of a long, lofty room,
with cubicles at each side and a passage down
the middle. The cubicles were divided by
wooden partitions, and were railed off in front
by pretty curtains. The whole arrangement was
pleasant, bright, and convenient; the drawback
being that sounds could be distinctly heard from
one cubicle to another. With this one disadvantage,
the cubicles possessed all the comforts of
small private rooms. In her own cubicle, each
girl could indulge her individual taste, and thus
give a certain indication of her character. Kate
O'Connor's was decidedly of the chaotic order.
As she entered it now, followed by her two companions,
she made a dash at her hat, scarf, and
gloves, which lay sprawling across her bed.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear!" she exclaimed, "how my Irish
nature does burst forth! Do stay near the door
for a moment, girls, or rather, I should say, near
the curtains. I'll set this room right in a jiffy.
Now, then, here goes!"</p>

<p>She pulled open a drawer, thrust her hat and
scarf out of sight, kicked a box under the bed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
pulled open the lid of her desk, swept a quantity
of papers into it, then faced her two companions
with her hands to her sides.</p>

<p>"<i>Voilà!</i>" she exclaimed; "now tell me, you
two, is there a more perfect room in the world?
The fact is this, I like a certain degree of order
on the surface and disorder beneath. I couldn't
live with tidy drawers; they'd drive me mad in a
week. I like a hay-stack in my drawers; there's
something exciting about never knowing where
to find your things. You pitchfork your hay-stack
up and down, and there's no knowing
what may unexpectedly turn up. There are
advantages in not being too well acquainted with
one's property. The other night, for instance, I
was in despair how to make myself look smart
to meet our beloved Leicester's angelic eye. I
suddenly came across two yards of pale green
ribbon buried under a lot of <i>débris</i> in the hay-stack.
I twisted half in my hair, and made a
knot of the remaining half for the neck of my
blouse. Leicester, the darling, looked at me
with much approval. Have I shocked you,
girls?"</p>

<p>"Not me," said Amy. "I know you far too
well."</p>

<p>"You have astonished me," said Molly. "I
certainly never thought you were untidy. You
don't look it a bit in your dress or hair. I rather
think I like you for it. I'm glad, at least, that
you are not perfect."</p>

<p>"You dear little quaint piece of goods!" said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
Kate. "How ridiculous it does sound to hear
you speak of me as perfect! Did you really
think so, even for a minute?"</p>

<p>"I did. Oh, now we can meet on common
ground. Kate, what are you laughing at?"</p>

<p>"I must have my laugh out," replied Kate.
"Amy, did you hear&mdash;did you hear what she
said? She thought me perfect! I, the dreamy,
the untidy, the reckless, the incorrigible! Bless
you, Molly! I have not laughed so heartily for
many a day."</p>

<p>"But you don't want to be the incorrigible?"
said Molly anxiously.</p>

<p>"Child, you'll kill me, if you look so solemn.
Can't you take a joke? Oh, what a trial it is for
an Irish girl to live in England! you English are
so painfully prosaic. Do believe one thing
about Kate O'Connor, my dear little Molly: it
is her fashion to talk at random. She would not
be Irish if she were not always propounding the
most impossible theories, and saying the most
impossible things. But when she does the queer
things and says the queer words, just make up
your mind that she is in fun, and doesn't mean
them to be taken seriously. Of course, when
she says sensible things she means them, and
that reminds me that we are here on a very
sensible matter. Now to business."</p>

<p>As Kate spoke, she leaped lightly into the
center of her bed, and sat there, tailor fashion,
with her legs tucked under her. She immediately
invited Molly and Amy to follow her example.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't think there is anyone in the next
cubicle," she said, "but I must find out. Hi,
Julia, are you there?"</p>

<p>As no answer came from Julia, Kate nodded
her head brightly.</p>

<p>"Empty on that side&mdash;so far, so good; now,
then, for the other. Mary Jane, love, are you at
home?"</p>

<p>Mary Jane being also silent, Kate clapped her
hands, and looked demurely at her companions.</p>

<p>"Now, then," she said, "this delicious little
plan wants explaining. Are you all attention,
girls?"</p>

<p>"I am," said Amy. "The fact is, I'm more
than attention&mdash;I'm devoured by curiosity."</p>

<p>Molly nodded, but did not speak.</p>

<p>"Well," said Kate, "my plan is this&mdash;I want
to form a society to eject selfishness from St.
Dorothy's."</p>

<p>Amy sighed deeply.</p>

<p>"Oh, Kate!" she cried; "I did think you
had got something sensible in your head at last.
What is the use of taking up wild, abstruse
ideas of that sort?"</p>

<p>"My idea is neither abstruse nor wild," replied
Kate. "Do listen, Amy; you can speak and
argue as much as you like when you know what
I mean. You and I, my dear, belong to the
afflicted tribe&mdash;we live in cubicles. We are the
Dwellers in Cubicles&mdash;that is our name. There
are times, Amy, when Mary Jane and Julia
make my cubicle anything but an abode of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
peace. I've not the least doubt that Harriet and
Pussy give you headache also at odd intervals.
It is not easy to write good epitomes of our
lectures when we are sitting between two fires of
idle badinage, chaff, silly stories, and sometimes
even&mdash;I'll just whisper the word&mdash;quarrelings.</p>

<p>"Now, in this house there are a certain number
of rooms which fortunate students hold
undisputed sway over. Some of these students
are obliging, and during the hours of study,
share their rooms with their less fortunate
friends; but others are selfish, perhaps from
thoughtlessness, and keep their rooms to themselves.
I have been racking my brains over a
careful calculation, and I find that, supposing
St. Dorothy's to be quite full, every student in
the place could be accommodated with a quiet
corner for study, if each girl who has a room to
herself would share it with one chum between
supper and prayer time. Of course, such a state
of things can't be enforced by any rules or any
order, but it is my belief that moral suasion can
do a good deal. I want to bring morality to
bear in the matter. I want to form a club, and
I want to force the girls to become members of
it; those who refuse can be sent to a sort of
moral Coventry. The object of the club will be
to wage war against selfishness, and particularly
against that awful form of selfishness which
sports its oak, to borrow an Oxford phrase,
against the suffering Dwellers in Cubicles. What
do you say, Amy, to my darling scheme?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, my dear, I should love it, of course,"
replied Amy; "but unfortunately I belong to
the Dwellers in Cubicles. Molly's opinion is
worth having, for she belongs to the opposite
side."</p>

<p>"I brought Molly here on purpose," said
Kate. "Molly is just in the position to give a
perfectly candid and unbiased opinion. She is
a privileged member of the Single-room Fraternity.
She has made no special friends as yet.
Now, Molly, you can tell me frankly what you
think of the scheme. How, for instance, would
you like to share your room with an outsider?"</p>

<p>Molly thought for a moment.</p>

<p>"You speak frankly to me," she said, "and I
must reply in the same spirit. I have a great
friend. I am hoping against hope that she may
come to St. Dorothy's. My friend is poor, and I
know that she will be obliged to come here in
the least expensive way. She will not have a
room to herself, and I look forward with great
pleasure to giving her any little privilege I can.
I hope that she and I may study together in my
room."</p>

<p>"Well, Molly, then you are in favor of the
plan?" said Kate, looking at her a little
anxiously.</p>

<p>"Yes; but then I am not unselfish, for it would
be delightful for me to have Cecil in my room."</p>

<p>Kate gave a faint sigh.</p>

<p>"No one knows the difficulties under which
the Dwellers in Cubicles labor," she exclaimed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
"I, for instance, have a passion for certain
kinds of work, but I'm afraid, although I manage
to please my lecturers, that I am something
of the scatter-brain order of human beings.
When I hear Julia and Mary Jane chatting and
quarreling, and calling across to each other
over my head, and sometimes rushing to meet
each other just outside my curtain, to exchange
either blows or kisses, I must own that my
poetic ideas or my thoughtful phrases are apt
to melt into a sort of Irish frenzy. The fact is,
under the existing condition of things, I indulge
in Irish frenzy every night of my life, and it is
bad for me in every way; it is simply ruining
my character. I get into a furious passion, then
I repent, and I get into bed really quite weak,
it is so fearfully exhausting."</p>

<p>"Oh, Kate, I can't help it!" exclaimed Molly.
"You must be my chum until Cecil comes.
Perhaps Cecil won't come at all. Oh, I fear as
much as I hope about that. If you will be satisfied
to be my chum, <i>only</i> until Cecil comes, you
are heartily welcome, Kate."</p>

<p>"You are a duck, and I accept heartily,"
said Kate, in her frank way; "but because I
have reached an ark of shelter, that is no reason
why I should not extend a vigorous hand to a
drowning sister."</p>

<p>"Mary Jane, for instance," exclaimed Amy.
"Who is the unfortunate victim who is to
admit that Dweller in Cubicles into her inner
sanctuary?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>"Twenty to one Mary Jane won't wish to
go," replied Kate. "Anyhow, the nice, honest,
hard-working, white sheep can't be crushed on
account of the black. I am going to draw up
rules for the new club to-morrow. I shall quote
Molly Lavender as a noble example of unselfishness.
I shall have an interview with Miss
Leicester, and get her to give her sanction to my
scheme. Oh, I'm certain she will, when she
recognizes the terrible position of the studiously
minded Dwellers in Cubicles."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.<br />

<small>CECIL AND THE BOYS.</small></h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-f.jpg" width="59" height="59" alt="F" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi">FOUR boys were seated round the break
fast table. They ranged in age from
fourteen to ten. One glance at their
faces was sufficient to show that they
belonged to the average healthy-minded, hearty,
English schoolboy. A girl was pouring out
coffee for the quartet. She was standing to
her work. Her age might have been sixteen:
in some respects she looked older, in some
respects younger. She was a tall, slim girl,
with a somewhat long face of a pale but clear
olive. Her eyes were dark, large, and well cut;
her brow was particularly noble. She had
quantities of straight, thick, black hair, which
was swept off her forehead and fastened in a
thick knot at the nape of her neck. The girl's
name was Cecil Ross. She was Molly Lavender's
dearest friend, the one around whom
Molly's warmest thoughts, hopes, and affections
were centered. The boys were eating their
breakfast with the voracious appetite of the
British schoolboy. The eldest had a look of
his sister.</div>

<p>"I say, Ceci," he exclaimed, "how white you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
are! You've been fagging last night; I know
you have, and I call it a beastly shame."</p>

<p>"Oh, never mind me, Maurice," said Cecil;
"I have to study, you know, and really you
four do want such a lot of mending and making
and seeing to generally, that if I don't sit up
a little bit at night, I simply get no study at
all. Jimmy, darling, is it necessary to put six
lumps of sugar into that cup of coffee?"</p>

<p>"There's no sweetening in this sugar," said
Jimmy, aged eleven; "I can't make it out.
What ails it? I put ten lumps in last night,
Ceci, when you were out, and the coffee only
tasted like mud."</p>

<p>"Like treacle, you mean," said Maurice.
"Don't you think it's a shame to waste good
food? You're a greedy youngster, and I'll
punch your head if you don't look out."</p>

<p>Jimmy bobbed his curly fair head, for Maurice
had extended one strong young hand as he
uttered his threat.</p>

<p>"It's time for us all to be off now," he said,
rising from the table and shaking the crumbs
from his Norfolk suit.</p>

<p>"Like dear boys, do go out quietly," said
Cecil; "Mrs. Rogers has spent a very suffering
night, and I don't want to wake her."</p>

<p>"Oh, bother!" exclaimed Jimmy; "what
with no sugar, and having to keep as still as
mice, how is a fellow to have a chance? I say,
Maurice&mdash;&mdash; Oh, I say, I didn't mean it; no, I
didn't, Ceci, not really."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>The boys clattered off; Cecil heard them
tumbling and scrambling downstairs; she uttered
a faint sigh for Mrs. Rogers' chance of
sleep, and then walked to the window to watch
them as they ran down the street. They attended
the Grammar School&mdash;the far-famed Grammar
School of the little town of Hazlewick; the school
was at the corner of the street.</p>

<p>"How Maurice grows!" thought Cecil, as she
watched them. "Of course, I know this sort of
thing can't go on. There's not money enough;
it can't be done, and how are they to be educated?
I wouldn't tell dear old Maurice what brought
the black lines under my eyes last night. No, it
wasn't study,&mdash;not study in the ordinary sense,&mdash;it
was that other awful thing which takes more
out of one than the hardest of hard work. It
was worry. Try as I would, I could not stretch
my cloth to cover the space allotted to it. In
short, at the end of the year, if something is not
done, I, Cecil Ross, will be in debt. Now, I'm
not going into debt for anyone. I promised
mother six months ago, when she died, that
somehow or other I'd keep out of debt, and I'll
do it. Oh, dear, dear! what is to be done? I
suppose I must give up that delightful scheme
of Molly's, that I should go to Redgarth for two
or three years, and perfect myself in all sorts of
learning, and then take a good post as head-mistress
of some high school. I don't see how it's
to be done&mdash;no, I really don't. What would the
boys do without me?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>At this point in Cecil's meditations, there
came a knock, very firm and decided, at the
sitting-room door.</p>

<p>"Come in," she said, and Miss Marshall, her
landlady, entered the room.</p>

<p>"Now, Miss Ross," she said, "I've come to
say some plain words. You know I'm a very
frank body, and I'm afraid I can't keep you and
those boys any longer in the house. There's
poor Mrs. Rogers woke up out of the first sleep
she's had the entire night. Oh, I don't blame
'em,&mdash;the young rascals,&mdash;but they simply can't
keep quiet. What are they but four schoolboys?
and all the world knows what it means when
there are four schoolboys in a house."</p>

<p>"I promise that they shall behave better in
future," said Cecil; "they must take off their
outdoor shoes in the hall and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Miss Marshall raised her hand; she was a
large-limbed, bony woman of fifty. She had a
thin red face, small but kindly eyes, and a firm
mouth. She would not be cruel to anybody;
neither would she be inordinately kind. She
was shrewd and matter-of-fact. She had to earn
her living, and she considered it her duty to put
this fact before all other considerations. Cecil's
white young face touched her, but she was not
going on that account to give way.</p>

<p>"It isn't that I don't love the lads," she said,
"and you too, Miss Ross, but the thing can't be
done. I make my living out of this house, and
Mrs. Rogers has sent for me to say she'll leave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
at the end of the week if I don't find another
place for you and your brothers, my dear. Mrs.
Rogers is the drawing-room lodger, and, what
with her being ill, and one thing and another, I
make a lot of extrys out of her. Now, I don't
mind letting you know, Miss Ross, that it's from
extrys we poor lodging-house keepers make our
profit. There's never an extry to put into your
account, my dear, and, besides, I <i>could</i> get ten
shillings a week more for these rooms, only I
promised your poor, dear ma that I wouldn't
raise the rent on you. The fact is, Miss Ross,
Mr. Chandler would gladly take the parlor and
the upstairs rooms for himself and his lady for
the whole winter, and I think I ought to put it
to you, my dear young lady."</p>

<p>"Of course," said Cecil.</p>

<p>She stood upright like a young reed. Her
brows were slightly knit; she did not glance at
Miss Marshall. She was looking straight before
her.</p>

<p>"I understand," she said, turning her gaze
full upon her landlady's red face, "that you
wish us to go?"</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear, it's sorry I am to have to say
it, but that's the plain fact."</p>

<p>"How long can you give us?"</p>

<p>"Do sit down, Miss Cecil; I declare you're
whiter than a sheet; you'll fade off like your
dear ma if you're not careful. There, my dear,
there, you shan't be hurried; you take your
time&mdash;you take your time."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's a dreadful position," said Cecil; "it
is fearfully inconvenient; there's not another
house where we can be so comfortable; there's
no one else will bear with us as you have borne
with us."</p>

<p>"Oh, for mercy's sake, my dear, don't you
begin that, or I'll yield&mdash;I declare I will! and
how am I to live if I don't raise my rent, and
seek lodgers that go in for extrys. Look here,
Miss Cecil, why do you burden yourself with
those young gentlemen; why don't you put them
to school?"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" said Cecil; "they
are at school."</p>

<p>"Why don't you put 'em to boarding school;
it would be a sight better, and cost less&mdash;and
there, I forgot to tell you, Miss Pinchin's English
teacher left her only yesterday; there is a
vacancy in that first class school for a good English
teacher; why shouldn't you try for it, Miss
Ross?"</p>

<p>"I don't know&mdash;I'm greatly obliged," said
Cecil. "I'll see what I can do, Miss Marshall,
and let you know to-night; perhaps you can give
us at least a week."</p>

<p>"That I can, and a fortnight too," said Miss
Marshall. "Dear, dear, it's a hateful job altogether,
and me that loved your ma so much. I
wouldn't do it, not for any Chandlers, but when
Mrs. Rogers, whose extras mount up wonderful,
threatens to leave, there seems no help for it.
Duty is duty, aint it, Miss Ross? and the best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
thing for a poor woman like me to see to, is that
she keeps her head well above water, and lays by
for her old age."</p>

<p>"Of course," said Cecil abstractedly. She was
scarcely listening to Miss Marshall. She was
thinking of the vacancy at Miss Pinchin's
school.</p>

<p>The landlady reached the door and half opened
it, then came back a step or two into the room.</p>

<p>"You might as well order dinner now, my
dear, while I'm here. What'll you have?"</p>

<p>"The cold mutton and potatoes," said Cecil.</p>

<p>"Bless you, child! there's only the bone downstairs.
Master Jimmy was mad with hunger last
night, and he stole down to the kitchen about
nine o'clock. That boy has the impudence&mdash;&mdash; 'Fork
out that cold mutton,' says he, 'I
can't sleep with a hollow inside of me. You
bring the cold mutton in here, and let me have a
slice or two.' I brought the joint and some bread,
and left him standing in the kitchen. When I
came back, why, 'twas nothing but the bone.
That child grows wonderful fast; you can't blame
him, poor lad."</p>

<p>"I do blame him for not speaking to me," said
Cecil; "but that is not your fault, Miss Marshall."</p>

<p>"Well, my dear, what'll you have for dinner?"</p>

<p>"Please put the bone down, and make a little
soup."</p>

<p>"That soup won't be ready for early dinner,
Miss Ross."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>"The soup will do for to-morrow's dinner. I
am going out in a few moments, and I'll bring
something fresh in from the butcher's. And
please make a very large rice pudding, Miss Marshall,
and let's have cabbage and plenty of
potatoes. I'll bring the cabbage in when I come.
I suppose there are plenty of potatoes left?"</p>

<p>"Never a one at all, my dear; you finished
the last supply yesterday."</p>

<p>Cecil sighed.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll bring potatoes too," she said.</p>

<p>The landlady closed the door at last, and Cecil
gave a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>"She's gone, and I can think," she said to
herself. "I'm glad she mentioned about the
vacancy at Miss Pinchin's school. Dear, dear!
I'd better put down what I'm to get when I go
out. I do wish Jimmy wasn't such a greedy
boy. Think of Maurice polishing off all the cold
mutton! Maurice is my blessing, the joy of my
life. Poor dear Jimmy is my perplexity&mdash;no, I
won't call him my cross. Charlie follows in
Maurice's footsteps; Teddy is inclined to think
Jimmy a hero. Oh, well, they are all four dear
boys, and I don't suppose I'd have them different.
Jimmy has no thought, and Maurice has too
much. Oh, my boy, how I love you! what
would I not do for you? You are so clever, so
manly, you could do anything if only you had a
fair chance. You shall have your heart's desire;
I'll manage it somehow. I'm four years older
than you; by the time you're fit to go to Oxford<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
or Cambridge, I'll have enough money to send
you there. Yes, yes, it shall be done."</p>

<p>Cecil's fine eyes began to shine, her beautiful
lips took a firm curve, the color crept slowly into
her pale cheeks. She sat down by her little
writing-table, pushed a Greek lexicon and other
books out of sight, and entered in a tiny notebook
the marketing which was necessary to be
done that day. "Beefsteak, potatoes, cabbage,
rice, sugar," she wrote, in her neat, small,
upright hand. She slipped the book into her
pocket, and then went out.</p>

<p>As she was leaving the house, the postman
came up the steps and gave her a letter. She
glanced at the writing, and the color rushed into
her cheeks.</p>

<p>"It's from Molly," she said to herself. "Oh,
what nonsense all this Redgarth scheme is!
How can I possibly leave those four boys, to go
to Redgarth? Of course I'd love it beyond
words, but it isn't to be done. Here, let me see
what Molly says."</p>

<p>Molly Lavender's letter was very short:</p>

<blockquote>

<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Darling Cecil:</span></div>

<p>I have only just time to write a line. I have heard from
father on the subject of your joining me, but he shifts the
whole question on to dear grannie's shoulders. The fact
is, Cecil, father is old-fashioned, and just because you are
the bravest girl in the world, he fancies that you must be
mannish. You mannish, you dear old feminine thing! I
comfort myself with the thought that he has never seen
you, Cecil. Oh, yes, it will be all right in the end. Grannie
knows you, and if she gives you a good character,&mdash;which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
of course she will, quite the best in the world,&mdash;you
are to come. I write now, however, to say that, with all
these delays, I don't see how you can come to St. Dorothy's
before the half term. Make up your mind to be with
us then. Oh, how I look forward to your arrival! I think
you will like the place,&mdash;you will be in your native atmosphere,&mdash;the
very air seems solemn with the weight of learning;
the college is splendid; as to the great hall, where we
have prayers, it almost takes your breath away the first
time you see it. Miss Forester is about the grandest woman
I ever came across. Oh, Cecil, how you will worship her!
St. Dorothy's is perfectly charming, only you've to get
your parquetry legs, or you'll have many a great fall.
The girls are full of character. I like one of them immensely;
her name is Kate O'Connor&mdash;she's Irish, and such
fun! She is chumming with me in my room until you
come. You will want to know what that means. It
means that she and I share my room, for purposes of study,
from after supper until prayers. Oh, Cecil, what good the
life will do you! you will expand in it like a beautiful
flower. You shan't have a care or sorrow when you come
here. How are the boys? Give my love to Maurice.</p>

<div class='sig'>
<span style="margin-right: 4em;">Your affectionate friend,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Molly Lavender.</span><br />
</div></blockquote>

<p>Cecil crushed the letter into her pocket, and
walked down the little High Street of the small
town.</p>

<p>"I don't see how I am to go to Redgarth," she
said to herself. "I don't suppose Judge Lavender
will lend the money, and even if he should
think of such a thing, how can I possibly go and
leave the four boys? Dear Molly was full of it
when we were together in the summer, and it did
seem so tempting, and I had a kind of hope that
perhaps Miss Marshall would look after the boys,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
and Maurice would be a sort of father to them.
But I see now it can't be done. Jimmy is too
much for Maurice, and why should my boy,
while he is so young, have this burden thrust
upon him? Oh, if I only could get that post as
English teacher at Miss Pinchin's school, why,
we'd be quite well off! I'd be able to save a
little, perhaps, and instead of going into lodgings,
I might take a tiny house, and have one servant.
I wonder which would be really cheapest? It's
impossible to keep four boys as mum as mutes.
Oh, of course, I'm sorry for Mrs. Rogers, but
boys will be boys. Now, everything depends on
what Miss Pinchin says. Miss Pinchin used to
be very kind to me when mother was alive, and
I don't see why she shouldn't give me the first
chance. Oh, I do sincerely hope I get the post!
I know Miss Edgar had eighty pounds a year.
Add eighty to one hundred and fifty, and it
makes two hundred and thirty. How rich we
should be with that! I certainly could manage
a little tiny cottage, and I expect I should save
in many ways. Yes, Molly dear, Redgarth is
certainly not to be thought of. If I can only
secure this unexpected post, which seems put in
my way!"</p>

<p>Cecil walked quickly as these thoughts rushed
through her mind. She had long left the little
High Street behind her, and had gone out into
the suburbs of the small town. There was a
beautiful country round Hazlewick, and the
autumn tints were now rendering the scenery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
perfect. Miss Pinchin's "Seminary for Ladies"
was an imposing-looking house, standing alone
in grounds. There were large white gates and a
carriage drive, and wide gardens stretching to
right and left and to the front and back of the
heavy stone building. Cecil opened the white
gates, walked up the avenue, and sounded the
bell at the front door. Her summons was
quickly attended to by a neatly dressed parlor-maid.</p>

<p>"Is Miss Pinchin in? Can I see her?" asked
Cecil.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid Miss Pinchin is particularly engaged,"
answered the servant.</p>

<p>Cecil hesitated a moment: she knew, however,
that such posts as Miss Edgar's were quickly
snatched up; desperation gave her courage.</p>

<p>"Please take Miss Pinchin my name," she
said; "Miss Ross&mdash;Miss Cecil Ross. Have the
goodness to say that I have come to see her on
very special business."</p>

<p>The maid withdrew, and Cecil waited on the
steps. Three or four minutes went by, then the
servant reappeared.</p>

<p>"Miss Pinchin can see you for a moment or
two, miss," she said. "Come this way, please."</p>

<p>She led the girl down two or three passages,
and entered a very small, prettily decorated
boudoir, where an elderly lady with iron-gray
hair, a sharp face, and a nose beaked like that
of an eagle, sat in front of a desk.</p>

<p>"How do you do, Miss Ross?" said Miss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
Pinchin. "Pray take a seat. Can I do anything
for you? Are your brothers well?"</p>

<p>"Yes, thank you, the boys are well,"
answered Cecil. She had to swallow a lump
in her throat.</p>

<p>"I have come," she said, "to offer myself for the
post of English teacher in your school. I heard
about an hour ago that Miss Edgar had left you."</p>

<p>Cecil's boldness&mdash;the sudden direct glance of
her eyes&mdash;alone prevented Miss Pinchin laughing
aloud. Her remark astonished the good
lady so much, however, that she was silent for
nearly a minute. At last, looking full at the
girl, she began to question her.</p>

<p>"I have a great respect for you, Miss Ross,"
she said; "your mother's daughter would
naturally have that from me; but&mdash;I scarcely
think you know what you are talking about."</p>

<p>"I assure you I do. I used to teach all the
English subjects at the last school where I was.
I was successful with the girls. They were fond
of me; they learned quickly."</p>

<p>"What are your attainments?"</p>

<p>"I know the ordinary branches of English
education; I have been thoroughly well
grounded. I know several languages also."</p>

<p>"Excuse me, Miss Ross, pray keep yourself
to English."</p>

<p>Cecil began to enumerate her different attainments
in this branch of study.</p>

<p>"I can give you good references," she said.
"I had first prize in English history on several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
occasions, and my compositions&mdash;they were
always above the average."</p>

<p>"I have heard that you are a clever girl,"
said Miss Pinchin; "in fact, anyone to look
at your face could see that. You certainly do
make the most extraordinary request. Miss
Edgar was thirty&mdash;how old are you?"</p>

<p>"I shall be eighteen in a week. Oh, please,
Miss Pinchin, don't let that interfere! I can't
help being young; that fact does not prevent
my having the care of four brothers."</p>

<p>"Poor girl! yes, yours is a heavy burden.
You might perhaps come to me for a time if&mdash;&mdash; By
the way, of course you have different certificates.
You have at least passed the Cambridge
Junior and Senior?"</p>

<p>Cecil colored, then her face became deadly
pale.</p>

<p>"No," she faltered, "but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No?" said Miss Pinchin, rising. "You
mean to tell me you have no certificate of any
kind?"</p>

<p>"No; but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My dear Miss Ross, I am sorry, but that
puts a stop to the entire thing. What would
the parents of my pupils say if my English
teacher were not thoroughly certificated! I am
sorry. Young as you are, I should have been
prepared to help you, for your mother's sake,
had you been in any way qualified. As it
is, it is hopeless. Good-morning, Miss Ross!
Good-morning!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.<br />

<small>MRS. LAVENDER'S PLAN.</small></h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-w.jpg" width="59" height="59" alt="W" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi5">WHEN Cecil found herself outside the
gates of Miss Pinchin's school, she felt
exactly like someone on whom the
gates of Paradise had been closed.
She had had a moment of strong and vigorous
hope; this had been changed as quickly to
despair. Miss Pinchin would have given her the
coveted post, had she been certificated. A girl
without certificates was nowhere now in the
world of learning. No matter how intelligent
she was, no matter how really well informed, she
had no chance whatever against the cut-and-dry
acquirements which the certificated girl was
supposed to possess. Cecil metaphorically
wrung her hands.</div>

<p>"What am I to do?" she said to herself. "I
know I can teach those girls just splendidly,
and because I have not passed the Cambridge
Junior and Senior, I am shut away from all
chance of getting a really good post. Oh, if I
could only go to Redgarth, if only for a year;
but there, I fear I must put that completely out
of my head. Molly's letter was scarcely reassuring,
and even if her father is willing to lend me
the money, how am I to manage matters for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
those dear, troublesome, good-humored, noisy
boys of mine?"</p>

<p>Cecil was walking back quickly to the town
as these thoughts coursed through her busy
brain. She was accustomed to utilize every
moment of her time, and anxious and miserable
as she felt this morning, these facts did not prevent
her accomplishing several little items of
necessary housekeeping with directness and
dispatch. She returned home in time to hand
over materials for a good dinner to Miss Marshall's
tender mercies, and then entered her little
parlor, sighing more than once as the reflection
came to her, that, in all probability, this little
home, this poor little haven of refuge, would not
long be hers.</p>

<p>The first thing her eyes lighted on as she came
into the room was a letter addressed to herself.</p>

<p>"The postman has just brought it, Miss Ross,"
said the landlady, whisking out of the room as
she spoke, and shutting the door after her.</p>

<p>Cecil took up the letter languidly. It bore
the London postmark, the writing on the cover
was stiff and slanting, and had the tremulous
appearance which generally characterizes the
writing of the very old. Notwithstanding this,
however, it was a careful and well-formed hand.
Cecil hastily tore it open, and read the following
words:</p>

<blockquote>

<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">My Dear Cecil</span>:</div>

<p>It is important that I should see you without delay. Can
your brothers spare you for one night? I have made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
inquiries, and find that you will receive this before noon
to-morrow. A train leaves Hazlewick for London at two
o'clock. If you take it, you will arrive at Paddington a
little before five. Do not lose that train, and come prepared
to sleep the night here. I will promise not to deprive your
young brothers of your company for more than one night.</p>

<div class='sig'>
<span style="margin-right: 4em;">Your affectionate old friend,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Mary Lavender</span>.<br />
</div>

<p>P.S.&mdash;I inclose a postal order for traveling expenses.
First-class fare; don't forget.</p></blockquote>

<p>A great flood of color mounted into Cecil's
pale cheeks as she read this unlooked-for letter.
She thought deeply for a moment, then resolved
not to lose a moment in going to see Mrs.
Lavender.</p>

<p>"The old lady, in all probability, wants to ask
me some questions before writing to Molly's
father," she said to herself. "Oh, I must put
Redgarth out of my head, but how splendid if I
only could go! If it were not for the boys, now;
but there, the boys exist, and they are the
treasures and joy of my life."</p>

<p>Cecil rushed up to her room to make preparations.
When Maurice and his three brothers
arrived for dinner, they were surprised to see
their sister in "her best bib and tucker," as
Jimmy expressed it.</p>

<p>"Now what's up, old girl?" asked that incorrigible
small boy.</p>

<p>"Nothing so dreadful, Jimmy," she answered.
"I am going to London by the next train, that's
all; expect me back, all of you, to-morrow.
Now I do hope you will try to be good boys."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, crikey!" said Jimmy, cracking his
fingers.</p>

<p>"And not wake Mrs. Rogers," pursued Cecil,
fixing her eyes steadily on the eager faces of the
three younger ones; "and, Jimmy, pray don't
go down again to the kitchen to eat food on the
quiet; you know that if you're hungry you've
only to tell me; we have not come to that pass
yet, that I would let any of my boys go hungry."</p>

<p>"I won't do it again," said Jimmy, turning
away from a look which Maurice gave him; he
did not want to meet Maurice's grave eyes.
Maurice used to tell him in private that he was a
beastly cad when he did mean things of that
sort.</p>

<p>"Now, look here," said Maurice, coming to the
front, as he always did when he noticed a look of
distress on Cecil's face, "I'm going to take care
of these youngsters. I promise, on my honor,
that they shall be as good as gold, and not do
one single thing you don't wish them to. Now,
sit down and eat a good dinner, Cecil. Why,
you look as white and tired as can be. No
nonsense; you're not going to help us. I'll
manage the dinner after you're gone. Sit down
and have a nice piece of steak. Let me be the
head of the house just for once."</p>

<p>"Oh, Maurice, what a comfort you are!"
exclaimed Cecil. "I wonder if you'd be such a
darling as to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nonsense! I'm going to be the darling now,"
said Teddy. "What do you want done, Ceci?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
Maurice isn't the only one who has got a pair of
legs, please remember, nor the only one who has
got a head on his shoulders, for the matter of
that."</p>

<p>"You'll do nicely, Teddy, thank you,"
answered Cecil. "Here's this postal order,&mdash;I
have filled my name in,&mdash;take it to the post
office, and bring me back the money. Now be
very careful and steady."</p>

<p>Teddy started off immediately on his errand.
In ten minutes' time he brought back the necessary
fare for Cecil's journey. She bade "good-by"
to her brothers, promised to be back in time
for early dinner on the following day, and
started off to the railway station with considerable
interest and excitement. All her low spirits
had vanished; life was once more rosy with
hope. It was very nice to get away from home
worries, even for twenty-four hours; to travel
first-class was in itself a pleasing variety.
When Cecil really found herself rushing away
in this comfortable style toward London, she
almost laughed aloud with girlish glee.</p>

<p>Cecil's face was naturally a grave one, but
when pleased or specially interested about anything,
it had a particularly eager and bright
expression. A wideawake look filled her dark
eyes; they seemed to take in at a glance all that
went on around her; hope shone in their brown
depths; smiles went and came round her happy
lips; an enthusiastic ring would even come into
the tones of her voice. Cecil's morning had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
been filled with difficulties, but this unexpected
and delightful change altered the whole complexion
of affairs. Cecil had gone through a
terrible year. A year ago she was a schoolgirl,
receiving an ordinary education, and looking
forward to doing well for herself in the scholastic
world by and by; but great trouble had come
unexpectedly&mdash;the mother to whom she was
devoted had died, and unlooked-for money
losses had added to the difficulties of the brave
girl's position.</p>

<p>She was now the sole guardian and care-taker
of her four young brothers, and although she
was possessed of splendid talents, and could
have earned plenty of money as a first-class
teacher, she had not the required certificates to
enable her to take any high position in the educational
world. Cecil was too proud to complain,
but the feeling that for lack of certain
technical knowledge she must always keep in
the background&mdash;that her gifts, however great,
could by no possibility meet with recognition&mdash;had
a terribly damping effect on her life. Miss
Pinchin's remarks to her that very morning had
seemed like the final extinguisher to every hope;
now, however, she could afford to laugh at Miss
Pinchin. After all, what did Mrs. Lavender
want her for? Why did she ask her to go to
her in such a hurry? Why did she pay her fare
up to town? Oh, yes, hope was again in the
ascendant; hope was sending Cecil's young
spirits up to a high pitch. How delightful it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
was to be flying along at express speed in a first-class
carriage! how luxurious those padded
cushions felt! how lovely the autumn tints on
the trees looked! There was Windsor Castle in
the distance; now she caught a peep of the river
Thames. How beautiful the world was, after
all!</p>

<p>"Oh, I shall succeed!" said Cecil to herself.
"After all, I shall succeed! Maurice shall have
the wish of his heart, and the three other boys
shall start in the world as gentlemen. I will do
all this for them. Yes, yes! Oh, I promised
mother when she was dying! I vowed to
succeed, and I will; I must, I shall. I am
young, and the world is before me, I feel the ball
at my feet. Won't I give it a good kick when I
get the chance? Oh, if only mother had lived,
what an old age of happiness I could have given
her! But there, I dare not think of that; but I
will succeed for the boys' sakes, and for the
sake of her sweet memory&mdash;oh, yes, oh, yes!"</p>

<p>The train arrived in due course at Paddington.
Cecil did not know London well, and she
had difficulty for a moment or two in keeping
her head in the midst of the whirl in which
she found herself. At last, however, aided by
an intelligent porter, she threaded her way in
safety to a hansom, gave the man Mrs. Lavender's
address, and was soon whirling away into
a fresh world. The distance from Paddington
to Bayswater was accomplished in a little over
ten minutes. The hansom drew up abruptly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
before the deep portico of a tall house, and
Cecil, feeling once more nervous and strange,
ran up the steps. The door was opened to her
by a neat parlor-maid, who told her that she was
expected, and took her immediately up a low
flight of stairs into a beautiful drawing room.</p>

<p>"Will you take a seat, miss," she said,
"while I go and tell my mistress that you have
arrived?"</p>

<p>Cecil sank into a deep armchair, and looked
about her. She had never been in Mrs. Lavender's
house before, although she had often been
regaled with descriptions of it from Molly.
Molly's holidays were spent in these rooms.
Yes, the drawing room was very pretty&mdash;handsome,
perhaps, was a better word. There were
a great lot of gimcracks, as Maurice would
term them, about: heaps of little tables, lots
of chairs of every description, pictures, photographs,
a stand of lovely ferns, a tall palm in
one corner, and just behind the palm, what?
Cecil, who was beginning to feel lonely and
a little strange, jumped up suddenly, pushed
the palm slightly aside, and gazed with delight
at a water-color drawing of Molly&mdash;it represented
Molly's sweet, frank face at its best. The
eyes smiled into Cecil's now, assured her of
Molly's faithful love, and cheered her inexpressibly.</p>

<p>The door opened behind. Cecil turned
eagerly; the parlor-maid had again entered the
room; she carried a little tea tray in her hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>"Will you please help yourself to some tea,
miss?" she said. "Mrs. Lavender begs that
you will do so. When you have quite finished,
will you kindly ring this bell, and I will come
and take you to your room? My mistress says
she will be glad to see you in her own boudoir
at six o'clock, miss."</p>

<p>"Thank you," replied Cecil.</p>

<p>The maid left the room, closing the door
softly behind her.</p>

<p>"What a quiet, hushed sort of feeling I
have!" thought Cecil to herself. "At home,
doors bang everywhere; don't the boys make
a clatter, even when they move! Even Miss
Marshall is not the quietest of souls. Yes,
everything is restless at home, and here there
is peace. I believe I could study here&mdash;or no,
perhaps instead of studying I should go to sleep.
I might become a lotos-eater, there's no saying.
Well, there is no chance of my lot falling to me
in this quiet place, and perhaps I am glad; but,
at any rate, a little rest is delightful, and this
tea looks delicious."</p>

<p>Cecil helped herself, pouring the tea into the
dainty china, dropping in tiny lumps of sugar,
and pouring cream out of a little embossed jug
of old silver. She was very thirsty, and ended
by drinking all the tea which the little teapot
contained, and finishing the wafer-like bread
and butter, which was scarcely a sufficient meal
for her healthy young appetite.</p>

<p>When she had finished, the maid reappeared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
to take her to a pretty little room, which, she
told her with a smile, belonged to Miss Lavender.</p>

<p>Cecil hastily washed her hands and smoothed
her hair, and punctual to the hour returned to
the drawing room. A moment or two later she
was ushered into Mrs. Lavender's presence.</p>

<p>The boudoir, as it was called, adjoined the
drawing room. It was a quaint little room,
furnished in the early French style. Everything
about it was extremely delicate. Most
of the chairs had high backs, the many small,
tables were of finished workmanship, and there
was a great deal of old china about. There
was a very thick carpet on the floor, and heavy
velvet curtains hung from the windows and
covered the entrance door. There was a hushed
sort of feel in the room, which made Cecil
inclined to speak in a whisper the very moment
she entered. Mrs. Lavender sat in a high-backed
chair by the fire. She was a tiny
woman, dressed in the period of sixty years
ago. She wore lace mittens on her little hands;
her dress was of dull black silk, a white muslin
kerchief was crossed over her bosom, and a cap
of the finest white lace adorned her snow-white
hair.</p>

<p>"How do you do, my dear?" she said, when
Cecil came in. "Sit down, pray sit down.
Anne,"&mdash;here Mrs. Lavender turned to the
servant,&mdash;"please be careful to shut the door
quietly, and don't come in on any pretext until
I ring for you. Now, my dear Cecil, you will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
wonder why I have sent for you in this hurry.
I have done so because an idea has come to me,
and suspense at my age is bad and disquieting.
I have an idea about you, Cecil. Before I tell
it to you, however, I want to know if you are
willing to be a sensible girl, and to do exactly,
and without any fuss, what I tell you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I will do anything," replied Cecil. A
flush of color rushed into her pale face. "Your
letter has excited me dreadfully," she said, looking
full at the old lady as she spoke.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lavender sighed. She had a delicate sort
of complexion, which belongs to certain temperaments.
Her face resembled old china, it was
transparently pink and white; her eyes were
bright blue. She looked old, but very pretty.
All her surroundings seemed in touch with her
fragile and <i>chic</i> appearance. As Cecil looked at
her, she felt suddenly quite out of harmony with
everything which surrounded her.</p>

<p>"How big I am!" thought poor Cecil. "I
hardly dare to rest on this chair; I am certain
if I lean back it will break. As to my hands,
they look quite enormous. I dread touching
anything. The fact is, there is not room for me
in this boudoir. I feel just like a bull in a china
shop. Oh, dear, dear! This is not the first time
I have seen dear Mrs. Lavender. Why do I feel
so nervous before her now?"</p>

<p>The pretty little old lady sat very still while
these thoughts were rushing through Cecil's
mind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>"There is not the least hurry, my love," she
said. "I have long passed the stage of being
excited about things. I can give you from six
to seven for this little interview. At seven I
dine alone. At eight o'clock we will meet in the
drawing room, where, perhaps, you will be kind
enough to read some of the <i>Times</i> articles for
me. At nine o'clock I go to bed. You can sit
up as long as you like. You will find novels,
and improving books, if you prefer them, in one
of the bookcases in the drawing room. I lead
a very precise life, but I do not require anyone
else to follow it. When Molly is here, she
always does exactly as she likes, and I never
interfere with her. You must copy Molly while
you are in this house, my dear. Now, are you
feeling composed, and is your excitement dying
down? I will tell you why I have sent for you,
if you can assure me this is the case."</p>

<p>"I am quite composed now, Mrs. Lavender,"
said Cecil. Then she added, with an irrepressible
sort of eagerness: "But you don't know how
good it is to be excited; how it lifts one out of
one's self, at least when one is young, as I am.
I was feeling very bad this morning, and now
I am full of hope. I am very grateful to you,
very, very grateful, for giving me such an exciting,
joyous day."</p>

<p>Mrs. Lavender raised one of her fragile little
hands. Her manner was deprecatory.</p>

<p>"Don't, my love!" she said. "Believe me, I
can quite understand your gratitude, but I really<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
would prefer your not expressing it. I suffer
from a weak heart, and the least emotion is bad
for me. It is quite possible that the plan which
I am about to divulge to you will excite you, as
you are of an excitable temperament. If this be
the case, Cecil, I must beg of you to leave the
room. Express your excitement in any way in
the drawing room. There are such thick curtains
between this room and that that I shall not
hear you, whatever you do. You may dance, if
you like, in there, provided you don't knock
anything over. Now, can you promise to be
calm in my presence?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Mrs. Lavender."</p>

<p>Cecil locked her hands tightly together. She
wondered that anyone could live, that any heart
could continue to beat, in such a death-in-life
sort of state as Mrs. Lavender's.</p>

<p>The old lady gave her a fixed stare.</p>

<p>"The girl I am fondest of in all the world,"
she said, "is my granddaughter, Molly. Molly
is very fond of you."</p>

<p>"She is my dearest friend," interrupted Cecil.</p>

<p>"I beg of you, Cecil, to hear me out without
remark."</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Cecil.</p>

<p>"I had a letter from Molly, in which she
entreats me to write to my son, who is, as you
know, a judge in the Rampoor Settlement. She
entreats me to write to him describing you as a
sensible, respectable, well-brought-up girl&mdash;a girl
who does not in any sense of the word belong to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
those odious creatures who call themselves 'new
women'; in short, a girl who would put no silly
thoughts into his daughter's head. You are
doubtless aware, Cecil, of the reason why Molly
wants me to write this letter?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I know all about it," replied Cecil.
Her face was crimson. "Molly wants her father
to lend me money to enable me to join her at
Redgarth. Her father fears I am not womanly
enough. Perhaps you don't think I am womanly
enough, Mrs. Lavender. Oh, if that is so, I beg
of you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hush, my dear, hush! Exclaim presently in
the drawing room, but do keep down your emotion
while you are with me. I shall have a spasm
if you don't; I really shall."</p>

<p>"I will try hard to be quiet," answered Cecil.</p>

<p>A great sigh rose to her lips, but she managed
to suppress it.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Lavender is a dear old lady," she said
to herself, "but I really fear she will soon ask
me not to breathe in her presence. I never felt
so horribly restrained in my life. I must make
a rush for that drawing room if she doesn't soon
unburden her mind."</p>

<p>"I have not yet written to my son," continued
the old lady.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, and the Indian mail has gone!"
answered Cecil.</p>

<p>"May I ask you, Cecil Ross," continued Mrs.
Lavender, "if you have the pleasure of knowing
my son, Judge Lavender?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, madam, of course not. I did not get to
know Molly until years after her father had left
England."</p>

<p>"I thought as much," said Mrs. Lavender,
nodding her head sagely. "Now, may I ask if
the idea has ever occurred to you, that by borrowing
money from a total stranger you are putting
yourself under a rather unpleasant obligation
to him?"</p>

<p>"But not to Molly's father&mdash;and I can pay it
back," replied Cecil anxiously.</p>

<p>"Allow me to finish what I was going to say,
my love. You want that money very badly?"</p>

<p>"In one sense, dreadfully; although, if I had
it, I don't know that I could use it."</p>

<p>"Pray don't get confused, Cecil, or my heart
will never stand the strain of having to talk to
you. In replying to my questions, confine yourself
as much as possible to 'yes' and 'no.'
Do you want this money badly?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, yes!"</p>

<p>"Why repeat it three times? Is not one 'yes'
sufficient? You want the money. Why?"</p>

<p>"Because I shall not be able to do what I
promised mother to do without it. There are the
four boys, all of them young, Maurice only
fourteen, and we have such a very little income;
and, Mrs. Lavender, I am not certificated, and
they won't give any posts to girls now who are
not; and oh, I know I have brains, and oh, it's
dreadful&mdash;oh, it's dreadful! Oh, I wish I could
half tell you what I feel about it!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>Cecil stood up as she spoke.</p>

<p>"Sit down at once, Cecil, or go into the drawing
room," replied Mrs. Lavender.</p>

<p>"Yes, I will sit down if you wish me to. I am
dreadfully afraid, by your tone, you do not
intend to write to Judge Lavender. If this is
the case, all is lost."</p>

<p>"How impatient you are, little girl!" said
Mrs. Lavender, in a kindly voice. "Do you
suppose I asked you to come all the way from
Hazlewick if I had nothing to suggest? Cecil,
my dear, I have long taken an interest in you.
I don't love you as I love Molly. Of course that
could not be expected of me, but I have a very
sincere regard for you. I am a rich woman.
My son is a very rich man. Most of my money
goes to him and Molly, but there is some&mdash;some
that I can leave just as I please. On the whole,
I am a lonely woman. At my age money has
very few attractions for me. All I ask of life
now is to be allowed great peace, great and
absolute stillness."</p>

<p>"I should think so," muttered Cecil.</p>

<p>"Great and perfect quiet. I am going away
soon to the everlasting rest. The life which
excites you so much is all behind me. I don't
need much money, and when I die, I have no one
to leave it to except Molly and her father, and
they have more money already than they know
what to do with."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 518px;">
<img src="images/p095.jpg" width="518" height="336" alt="Older woman and girl sitting by fire" />
<div class="caption">"THERE IS NOT THE LEAST HURRY, MY LOVE," SHE SAID.</div>
</div>

<p>Cecil opened her lips to utter an exclamation.</p>

<p>"Don't!" said Mrs. Lavender. "I know by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
the shape of your mouth that you are going to
say something violent, and I simply can't listen
to it. Now, I will tell you briefly why I sent for
you. I take an interest in girls like you.
Once, long, long ago, I was excitable like you.
I was full of spirits; I thought I could never
make enough out of life, I was as poor in
those days as I am rich now. On the whole, I
was much happier while I was poor. It is a great
mistake to imagine that money means happiness.
I have made a curious will, Cecil Ross. In that
will, I am leaving the money which does not
rightly belong to Molly and her father in small
sums to several girls whom I have heard or know
about. When this will was signed, your name
was included."</p>

<p>"Mine?" said Cecil.</p>

<p>"My dear, the drawing room!"</p>

<p>"Oh, I will be good! I won't say another
word. Do go on!"</p>

<p>"Your name was mentioned in the will, Cecil.
In that will I leave you at my death five hundred
pounds. Now, it has occurred to me, after reading
Molly's letter, that it would be much kinder,
and more useful to you, to have the use of the
money now. You are a clever girl. My dear,
don't get so red, or you will have an apoplectic
seizure. You are a clever girl, Cecil, but you are
not half educated according to the modern craze.
Five hundred pounds will educate you well.
Afterward you will be able to support yourself,
and to help your young brothers. Your mother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
was an excellent woman. I took a great fancy to
her when I met her two years ago. My proposal,
then, my dear, is simply this&mdash;don't borrow
money. Borrowed money is a curse, and a weight
round the neck of anyone. Don't put yourself
under an obligation to my son. Allow me to pay
your expenses at Redgarth, and to give you ten
pounds a term for pocket-money. Now, don't
speak! Think over what I say, and give me
your decision after dinner."</p>

<p>"Oh," said Cecil, "oh, I&mdash;I must go into the
drawing room for a minute, please."</p>

<p>"Do, dear child, do; go at once. Draw back
that curtain; open the door; pray shut it
noiselessly."</p>

<p>"She's gone; what a relief! Poor little
creature, if she'd let out what she's feeling, she
would have killed me on the spot," murmured
Mrs. Lavender, sinking back on her high-backed
chair with, a gentle and satisfied sigh.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.<br />

<small>AN OUTRAGEOUS PROPOSAL.</small></h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-h.jpg" width="58" height="59" alt="H" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi4">"HOW interested you look, Cecil!" said
Maurice.</div>

<p>The four boys were all waiting at the
little station of Hazlewick when Cecil
alighted on the platform.</p>

<p>"You look jolly well," interrupted Jimmy.</p>

<p>"Yes, I feel as well as possible," said Cecil.</p>

<p>"Then give us a hug, do," said Teddy.</p>

<p>He flung his arms roughly round his sister's
neck, pushing her hat crooked and disarranging
her black necktie.</p>

<p>"Oh, I say, how red your cheeks are!" said
Charlie. "London must be a jolly healthy
place; you were as white as a sheet when you
went there, and now you've come back with
your eyes shining, and your cheeks like apples.
I say, had you lots of fun? What sort is the
old lady? Did she give you a good time, and
have you brought us back anything?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I have a parcel here," said Cecil.</p>

<p>"I say! gimini! crikey! golluptious!" burst
from Teddy's lips. He instantly began to dance
a hornpipe, and Jimmy rushed down the platform,
head over heels, to the distress and agony
of several passengers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, do come out of this, boys!" said Cecil.
"How can I say anything to you in the midst
of all this noise? Yes, I have news. I'm afraid
it's rather selfish news&mdash;I mean it is very good
for me; but&mdash;but you may not like it at present.
Whether anything can come of it or not rather
depends on the way you take it. Oh, I will tell
you after tea; you must have patience till then&mdash;you
really must."</p>

<p>"When is that parcel to be opened?" asked
Charlie. "We can wait for the news, if you
will only open the parcel. I say, let's sit by the
hedge and get that part done. The news will
keep, if you let us see what you've brought us,
Cecil. Oh, I say, do have pity on a fellow!
My skull will burst if I'm exposed to suspense
another moment."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, boy!" said Maurice. He gave
a quick glance at his sister, who, under all her
excitement, looked tired. "It was awfully
good of Ceci to bring anything back, and you're
not even to smell the contents of this parcel
until she wishes it opened. Come, you know
me, you three rascals&mdash;so no more words."</p>

<p>Jimmy made a face, Teddy gave a heart-rending
sigh, and Charlie danced in front of the rest
of the party.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll be good!" said Charlie; "I'll be as
good as gold, and Ceci will have mercy then;
won't you, Ceci? I do hope you've brought me
a knife, Cecil&mdash;a knife with two blades, and a
corkscrew, and one of those things for picking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
stones out of horses' feet; that's the sort of
knife I want. Ben Lester has a knife of that
sort, and I bet him sixpence I'd have one before
the month was out. You've got me a knife,
haven't you, Cecil?"</p>

<p>"Shut up!" growled Maurice. "Take my
arm, Cecil. Now, boys, you can run on in
front. Tell Miss Marshall that Cecil is back,
and ask her to make the tea; and hark, don't
you make a row, or I'll punch your ears. Now,
off the whole three of you!"</p>

<p>The younger boys rushed on, and Cecil was
alone with Maurice.</p>

<p>He was tall for his age; he had broad shoulders
and an upright carriage. Cecil found his young,
strong arm full of support. She leaned on it
gladly, but while she did so, a thrill of pain went
through her heart. Had she any right to leave
the boys? Could she leave them? Was she not
selfish in putting this great chance, which was
so unexpectedly offered her, before her duty to
the boys? Cecil's mind had been tormented
with doubts all the way home, and now, as
she leaned on Maurice and walked toward Miss
Marshall's lodgings, these doubts seemed to get
worse than ever.</p>

<p>"You don't look so well as you did five
minutes ago," said Maurice, glancing at her.</p>

<p>"I am very happy, and yet I am very much
worried," she said. "Mrs. Lavender sent for
me to make a most astounding proposal. I will
tell you frankly, Maurice, that it took my breath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
away yesterday; and I could think of nothing
but myself, and the delight of the whole thing.
But to-day, and especially since I have seen your
dear old face, I fear&mdash;I greatly fear&mdash;that I shall
only be a selfish girl if I think of it."</p>

<p>"No; that I'm sure you won't," said Maurice
heartily. "Just tell me what it is before you
talk to the other boys. We needn't discuss it,
but I may as well think it over while we are having
tea."</p>

<p>"You're such an old brick, Maurice," said
his sister. "I do declare you've got an old
head on young shoulders."</p>

<p>"I'd need to have," said Maurice, with a sigh;
"those boys are enough to worry any fellow
sometimes&mdash;oh, not that I mean to complain; it
is nothing at all to what you have to bear. Now,
out with your news, Cecil."</p>

<p>"I don't see how it's to be done," said Cecil,
turning pale.</p>

<p>Maurice stopped abruptly.</p>

<p>"Out with it before we go a step farther," he
said. "Now, then. Why, Cecil, you're trembling,
old girl!"</p>

<p>"I am," said Cecil, tears suddenly filling her
eyes. "It means so much, and I'm tempted."</p>

<p>"Those young rascals will be back if you're
not quick, Ceci."</p>

<p>"Well, here it is then, Maurice; here's the
subtle temptation. Mrs. Lavender wants to
make me a present of five hundred pounds."</p>

<p>"I say!" exclaimed Maurice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;five hundred pounds; she wants to
give it to me now for my education. She wants
me to go to Redgarth, where Molly is, you
know, Maurice. She wants me to join Molly at
St. Dorothy's. She will pay all my expenses
out of this sum of money, and will allow me ten
pounds a term for pocket-money. That is the
proposal, Maurice, and it dazzles me&mdash;and I'm
weak, and I long to take it; but&mdash;but,&mdash;oh,
Maurice, darling, don't look at me with your
grave eyes like that,&mdash;do you think I'll desert
you? No, no&mdash;never, never!"</p>

<p>"Stuff!" said Maurice abruptly. He turned
his head away; he didn't speak at all for a
moment.</p>

<p>"You are angry with me, Maurice, for even
speaking about it," said Cecil; "but I promise&mdash;yes,
I promise! the look on your face is enough.
Don't think of it again, dearest, and the younger
boys need never know."</p>

<p>"Stuff and nonsense!" said Maurice. "You
will forgive me for being a little bit stunned, just
for a minute, Cecil. I never thought of life
without you just at present, but if you think
I'm going to be such a brute as to stand in your
way&mdash;&mdash; Oh, I say, Cecil, don't talk to the boys
to-night. Let us wait until the morning. I
must arrange my ideas. Why, the whole thing
is just splendid, Cecil! Think of you, educated
as you ought to be! Why, we none of us have
talents like you."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes! <i>you</i> have, Maurice."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, I haven't; not a bit of it. Oh, I don't
pretend I'm stupid, or any humbug of that sort,
but I'm not like you. Give you advantages and
you'd set the Thames on fire. Yes, now, that's
the very word. Listen to me now, Cecil; don't
say a word to the other fellows until you and I
have had a conference and put this thing
straight. Promise&mdash;we're just home."</p>

<p>"Maurice, you're the dearest fellow in all the
world."</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it, only I've got common sense,
and I know when a good thing is offered to us
all. Now, here we are. Well, you lads, is the
tea ready?"</p>

<p>Tea was a very joyous and exciting meal.
Even the knowledge that Mrs. Rogers was in
the house could not keep the boys from shouting
with laughter, and expending their wit on that
crooked and bulging brown paper parcel which
Cecil had brought back from London with her.
Maurice was one of the gayest of the group.
When Maurice gave himself away, as the other
boys phrased it, they felt that the cords of
discipline were thoroughly relaxed; they were
almost too excited to eat, and Cecil, in spite
of herself, could not help joining in their mirth.</p>

<p>Immediately after tea, however, Maurice got
up and prepared to leave the room.</p>

<p>"Where are you off to?" said Jimmy.
"She'll open the parcel now. What in the
world are you going away for?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll be back soon," said Maurice. "You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
can give the boys those things, Cecil. If you
have thought of me, keep it. I will see what it
is when I come back."</p>

<p>"Well, of all the rum starts&mdash;&mdash;" began
Teddy.</p>

<p>But Maurice slammed the door behind him,
and a moment later was seen marching down the
street. He walked quickly, his hands shoved
deep into his pockets, his cap pulled over his
eyes. Presently he reached an ugly and very
unpretentious house, which stood a little back
from the Grammar School. He rang the bell
vigorously. His summons was attended to by
a little man with a shock of red hair and a
freckled face. The little man had humorous
blue eyes, a stern mouth, lantern jaws, and a
chin which testified to the extreme obstinacy of
his character.</p>

<p>"Now, what have you come about, Ross?"
he said. "I really can't be bothered at this
hour. I've been working with you boys all day,
and it's monstrous to have a man's time taken
up out of school hours. No; if you want me to
tell you anything about your Latin translation,
or that passage in Homer which you made such
a mess of this morning, I won't; so there!"</p>

<p>"I want nothing of the kind," said Maurice.
"You can scold me when I make you angry, Mr.
Danvers. I want to speak to you for a moment.
May I come in?"</p>

<p>Mr. Danvers had only opened his door from
four to five inches while he was expostulating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
with Maurice. Now he flung it open with a sort
of snarl, and said:</p>

<p>"Come in, if you wish to; come in, if you
insist. This is my parlor, bedroom, kitchen, all
in one. A pretty cheerful-looking apartment, is
it not?"</p>

<p>"It's all right," said Maurice. "I haven't
come to see your room, but to see you."</p>

<p>"Well, well; find a chair if you can, lad. I
was frizzling bacon when you came in. Do you
mind if I go on with it?"</p>

<p>"Let me help," said Maurice.</p>

<p>"Preserve us, no! I like my bacon done to a
turn. Hands off, youngster! You can talk to
me while I am eating my supper."</p>

<p>Maurice lounged against the window-sill.
There was literally not a disengaged seat in
the room. Mr. Danvers had described it as
kitchen, bedroom, parlor, but it was also, and
above all these things, library. Books on the
floor, books crowding the bookcases, books in
heaps on the windowsill, books on the bed,
books on every table and every chair, marked
all too vividly the tastes of John Danvers, the
classical master of the Grammar School, the
most hard-headed, soft-hearted, irascible-tempered,
touchiest, most generous man in the
whole of Hazlewick.</p>

<p>"Now, then, Ross, you can state your business,"
said Danvers, as he munched his bacon
with appetite. "Do you see that pile of exercise
books there? I've got to look through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
them all between now and ten o'clock. They
are every one of them the choice productions of
idiotic asses, so you may imagine the treat which
lies before me. Now then, Ross, speak out."</p>

<p>"I'd best plump it," said Maurice. "I want
to know, Mr. Danvers, if you'll board me and
my three brothers? Don't say 'no,' till you
think it over. We won't be any trouble, and
you've heaps of room in this house."</p>

<p>When Maurice made this astounding proposal,
Mr. Danvers' face became a study. His mouth
opened until it formed itself into a round O; his
blue eyes twinkled with the queerest mixture of
anger and uncontrollable mirth. He was in the
act of helping himself to a delicious morsel of
frizzled bacon; he kept his fork suspended in
mid air.</p>

<p>"Please don't speak for a minute," said
Maurice, whose face was crimson. "I knew
you'd funk it; I knew you'd hate it; I know
perfectly well it would be beastly for you. All
the same, I want you to do it; it will be beastly
for us too, but I want you to do it. Yes, you
shall do it, because&mdash;because&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Your reasons, lad?" said John Danvers.</p>

<p>He sprang to his feet, pushed aside his meal
with a clatter, walked to the door, turned the
key in it, and then strode up to where Maurice
was, half sitting, half lounging.</p>

<p>"Now, out with your reasons, and be quick!"
he said. "I don't want my bacon spoiled and
my evening spoiled; I'll turn you out of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
room, you young rascal, if you're not quick!
Why am I to turn my life into an inferno?
Now, be quick; out with your thought, lad!"</p>

<p>Mr. Danvers' last sentence was spoken with
a certain softening of voice which encouraged
Maurice to proceed.</p>

<p>"I'm desperate," he said, "and desperate
people come to desperate resolves. It is for
Cecil; she's the best girl in all the world, and
the cleverest; but she's not half educated. She
was at a school, not a tip-top school, but just a
middling sort of place. I wish now she'd gone
to a decent High School, but mother didn't like
High Schools, and anyhow, there she is, nearly
eighteen, with more talents than all the rest of
us put together, but shut out of everything,
because she hasn't got certificates, and all that
sort of rot. Well, she's got a chance; an old
lady, a friend of ours, wants to pay her expenses
at Redgarth College. Perhaps you've heard of
Redgarth, Mr. Danvers?"</p>

<p>"I have, and of Miss Forester," said John
Danvers. "Women are being taken more and
more out of their sphere day by day. Go on,
boy&mdash;your ideas amuse me; so I'm to enter
purgatory for the sake of a girl. Go on, pray!"</p>

<p>"No," said Maurice; "I wish I were the same
age as you, sir, or you were the same age as me,
and we'd fight this out, not for the sake of a
girl in the ordinary sense of the word, but because
of the best sister a fellow ever had, and
we want to give her a chance&mdash;at least I do."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>"And you propose to send me to a lunatic
asylum?"</p>

<p>"Not quite; we wouldn't be as bad as that.
You own the whole of this house, don't you?"</p>

<p>"What's that to you, you young dog?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but don't you?"</p>

<p>"Fact, Maurice Ross; I also own a digestive
system, which is going to be put frightfully out
of gear by this night's work."</p>

<p>"Oh, I wish you'd take the matter seriously.
We boys want a bedroom, and any ramshackle
sort of place to work in. I engage, on my
honor, to keep the three younger lads in order.
I know a bit of cooking, and we can manage our
own meals, and we can pay you for every scrap
of expenses you are put to, and you can have
a bit of profit over and above."</p>

<p>"You can leave the profit out, young Ross."</p>

<p>"Well," said Maurice, "will you, or won't
you? Will you make yourself beastly miserable
for the sake of a brave girl? She can't
help being a girl, but she can help being brave,
and she is&mdash;oh, you don't know how plucky she
is. It puts me to shame the way she works,
and the way she denies herself. Do you know
what she's got in the back of her head? To
send me to Oxford by and by, to make a man
of me, and to provide a comfortable home for
the other boys when they are older and need it
more. I couldn't ask a woman to put herself
out to give Cecil this chance, but I thought a
man might, if he were worth the name."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>"Upon my word, you're pretty frank, you
British schoolboy," said Danvers; but his eyes
danced again, and he ceased to cast loving
glances in the direction of his bacon.</p>

<p>"Will you, or won't you?" said Maurice;
"that's just it? You needn't deliberate&mdash;you
can say a frank 'yes' or 'no.' I don't pretend
you'll like it&mdash;of course you won't; but maybe&mdash;&mdash; Oh,
I don't want to cant, but if there's anything
in those words, 'It is more blessed&mdash;&mdash;'"</p>

<p>"I know 'em; you needn't finish them,"
interrupted Danvers. "It's 'yes' or 'no,'
then. What a queer world this is! Here am I,
bullied by one of the boys in my class, a young
ruffian who murders his Homer, and nearly
turns my brain over his Virgil; he comes and
beards me in my own private den, with the most
astounding, outrageous, unheard-of proposal&mdash;and
it's 'yes' or 'no' with the monkey.
What will you do if I say 'no,' sir?"</p>

<p>"I'll be as I was before," answered Maurice;
"but you won't, sir."</p>

<p>"I won't! Is that the way you take it?"</p>

<p>"No, sir; I see yielding in your face. I
wouldn't have come to another master in the
whole school."</p>

<p>"You needn't blarney me, Ross; blarney is
the last straw. Now, you've stated the fact
from your point of view. Allow me to tell you
what this will mean to me. Lunacy, an asylum,
in three months. Tell me to my face, is there a
girl living who is worth that?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>"It won't be all that," said Maurice, with one
of his slow smiles; "and Cecil is worth nearly
that."</p>

<p>There was a look in Maurice's eyes just then,
that made Danvers turn his head aside.</p>

<p>"Upon my word, there must be something in
the girl," he said to himself. "What a lad this
is, after all!"</p>

<p>Aloud he said, after a brief pause, "And suppose
I agree?"</p>

<p>"Cecil will be perfectly happy and contented."</p>

<p>"But she doesn't know me, and I never laid
eyes on her in my life."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, you did! you must. She goes to
church with us every Sunday."</p>

<p>"I never look at women when I can help it,"
said Danvers. "I keep my eyes on my book in
church, and when your head master preaches, I
shut them; no, I don't go to sleep, so you needn't
wink, you dog! I can think better with my eyes
shut."</p>

<p>"Well, at any rate," said Maurice, "Cecil
knows about you; she knows we'd be safe with
you."</p>

<p>Danvers uttered a deep groan.</p>

<p>"Oh, get out of this, Ross," he said; "don't
let me see your face again until to-morrow at
school, so out you go&mdash;quick&mdash;run&mdash;get out of
my presence! A pretty nut you've given me to
crack."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.<br />

<small>MR. DANVERS ORDERS FURNITURE.</small></h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-w.jpg" width="59" height="59" alt="W" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi5">WHEN Maurice had really left the house,
John Danvers returned to his untidy,
complex room, and threw open both
windows.</div>

<p>"Stuffy," he muttered, sniffing as he spoke.
"Let in plenty of air&mdash;nothing like air. Now,
then, for my supper. Digestion will be all wrong
to-night. Oh, good Heavens! what sin have I
done, that this appalling dilemma should be
presented to me? Won't think of it! Supper
comes first, then all those themes. Never heard
of a lad like Maurice Ross in all my life before&mdash;won't
think of him. That passage in Cæsar
which I read this morning is worth pondering
over; meant to go to sleep on it to-night&mdash;will
still. The cheek of that young beggar! won't
think of him; I vow I won't! This bacon is
destroyed; 'willful waste makes woeful want'&mdash;&mdash; That's
what comes of listening to cheeky&mdash;&mdash; Won't
revert to that dog."</p>

<p>John Danvers pushed up his red hair until it
stood upright on his forehead. Then he sat
plump down on the nearest chair, placed a thin
hand on each knee, and gazed straight before
him at all his books. He made an admirable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
scarecrow, sitting thus; and would have been the
delight of every boy in his class, had they had the
privilege of gazing at him. The bacon frizzled
and burned on the pan, but he took no notice of
it. Finally he put his supper away untasted,
then lit his lamp, and sat down with thirty
exercise books before him.</p>

<p>"As if this were not enough," he muttered.
"For what sin am I so sorely punished? A girl
wants to learn what she'd better not know, and
I'm to go to Bedlam. If I were another man,
I'd say 'no.' I always knew I was composite,
and this proves it. I'm beastly weak; wish I
weren't. Shouldn't think of it a second time, if
I hadn't this abominable vein of good-nature
running through me. That's the composite element
which has destroyed my chance in life.
For the sake of a girl&mdash;&mdash; Faugh! If it were a
boy indeed! I take an interest in those torturing
young beggars in spite of myself, and Maurice
Ross is my favorite, and he knows it, the dog!
Well, I'll sleep it over. Hang it, though, I don't
believe I'll sleep a wink!"</p>

<p>John Danvers ate no supper that night. He
was quite unaware of this fact, however, himself;
he also failed to correct any of the exercise
books, and the boys who had made a sad hash
of their Latin and Greek got off scot-free the
next morning. Next day in school he avoided
Maurice Ross' eye. In the afternoon he started
off for a long walk by himself. It was a half-holiday,
and he could do this with impunity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
On his way back he called at Miss Marshall's
house.</p>

<p>"Is Miss Ross in?" he asked of the landlady,
who knew him well, for he was one of the characters
of the place, and was known to be a
woman-hater.</p>

<p>Miss Marshall ran upstairs, and came down
with the information that Miss Ross was in.</p>

<p>"I'll see her for a moment, if she has no
objection," said Danvers.</p>

<p>Miss Marshall led the way upstairs.</p>

<p>"How do you do?" said Danvers, when he
found himself in the presence of the girl for
whom he was to go to Bedlam.</p>

<p>Cecil was seated by her writing-table; there
was perplexity on her face, dark rings under her
eyes; her sweet mouth looked slightly fretful.
The fact is, she was making up her mind to
decline Mrs. Lavender's offer.</p>

<p>Danvers came in and stood in front of her.</p>

<p>"Won't you sit down, Mr. Danvers?" said
Cecil, who of course knew the little man very
well indeed by sight.</p>

<p>"No, thank you, madam; I prefer to stand."</p>

<p>Cecil stood also. She looked at the little
classical master in some wonder.</p>

<p>"Fine young woman," he muttered to himself.
"She'd make a capital milkmaid; education
thrown away on her; women's brains are
smaller than men's. Providence doesn't mean
them to meddle in things too deep for them. I
don't do it for her sake, not a bit of it; it's the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
lad, fine lad; life before him, life half over with
me; old dog gives way to young dog; way of
the world&mdash;way of the world."</p>

<p>"I wish you'd take a chair, Mr. Danvers,"
said poor Cecil, who thought that the little man
with his red hair sticking up over his head, and
his shining blue eyes, and his dogged mouth and
jaw, must have taken leave of his senses.</p>

<p>"Not worth while, madam. I've come to say
that, if you wish it, I'll house those boys, give
them house-room, beds to sleep in, plenty to eat
and drink. I'll take 'em for what you can
afford; they'll be safe enough with me. I'm a
dragon on boys, Miss Ross, a very dragon on
boys. You'll be quit of 'em, I came to say it.
You can fix up things with your brother
Maurice; and they can come to-morrow if they
like. Communicate with me through Maurice;
he's a fine lad. Good-day to you, Miss Ross!"</p>

<p>Before Cecil had time to say a word, Danvers
strode out of the room. He ran downstairs so
quickly that someone might almost have propelled
him from behind, and rushed out of the
house as if he were shot.</p>

<p>"I have done it," he said, as soon as he had
got into the street. He gasped as he spoke.
"Good gracious!" he said; "what an awful
thing it is to come face to face with a woman,
and a young one, too! She's a fine girl, I don't
deny it; good eyes, firm, nice mouth. She
looked at me, all the same, as if she meant to
eat me. Good Heavens! what a heat I'm in;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
this sort of thing will kill me if I have much
more of it."</p>

<p>Danvers walked down the street; he held his
head in the air, and his soft hat was well slouched
back. Several people who knew him well met
him, but he noticed no one. His bright, kindly
blue eyes were fixed upon the kindly sky. In
spite of himself, against his will, there was a
glow of pure happiness at his heart. He would
not acknowledge the happiness. He kept on
muttering:</p>

<p>"John Danvers, you dog, you've let yourself
in for a pretty mess! Fancy four boys, four
devouring young monsters, careering over your
house, rushing into your private den, shouting
into your ear, dancing the devil's tattoo over
your very bedroom. It's too awful to contemplate.
I'll not think of it. I vow and declare
I'll turn my thoughts to something else. What
about that passage in Cæsar I construed last
night? It's a fine thought and a comforting one.
After all, there's nothing like going back to the
fountain head of knowledge, and taking your
ideas straight from the original well. Yes,
Cæsar is good meat, nothing namby-pamby
there. I mean to go on with my translation during
the coming winter. What am I saying?
What am I saying? What chance have I to
translate anything? Bedlam without and Bedlam
within will be my portion from this day forward.
How blue the sky is, though! it's a fine
evening. The breeze is pleasant, quite spring-like.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
Good Heavens! I did have a job when I
stood face to face with that girl; but Maurice is a
fine lad, and he's young, and he has his life before
him. Shouldn't be surprised if he made a good
Latin scholar yet. By the bye, didn't I see a
Greek lexicon on that girl's table? Outrageous,
monstrous, indecorous! A woman has no right to
look into these mysteries. She's made for bread
and butter and cheese and household drudgery.
Some men may go to the length of considering
her ornamental, but, thank Heaven! I have never
so completely lost my senses. Well, I've done
it, but not for the sake of a woman&mdash;no, Heaven
forbid! Now, then, to complete the sacrifice."</p>

<p>Danvers suddenly hastened his steps; he
turned abruptly into a little side street, and,
stopping at the door of a second-hand warehouse,
he entered in a hesitating manner.
Apart from his books and boys, Danvers always
exhibited nervous hesitation. The man in the
shop, a person of the name of Franks, came up
to greet him.</p>

<p>"Can I do anything for you, Mr. Danvers?"
he asked.</p>

<p>Danvers frowned when his name was mentioned.
He had not the faintest idea of the
name of the owner of the shop, and nothing
annoyed him more than the fact that every soul
in Hazlewick seemed to know him perfectly well.</p>

<p>"Good-evening!" he said abruptly. "The
fact is, I've called in to ask you to send in
some furniture suitable for a dog's&mdash;I mean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
a boy's bedroom. There are four boys; the
rascals&mdash;I mean the young fellows&mdash;are coming
to stay with me. I want a room furnished&mdash;you'd
better send a man round to look at it&mdash;the
usual things, of course. Send in the furniture
to-morrow. Good-evening!"</p>

<p>"But I beg your pardon, Mr. Danvers," said
the perplexed shopman, "your order is a little
vague; you have not told me what class of
furniture you require."</p>

<p>Danvers took off his hat, and pushed up his
red hair perfectly straight.</p>

<p>"Simple, very," he said; "no luxuries, a
bed apiece, some basins and jugs; you know
the sort of thing. I am in a hurry. I will
wish you 'good-evening!'"</p>

<p>"We have got some nice iron bedsteads,"
began Mr. Franks, "neat and plain. I suppose
carpets will be required. If you will have the
goodness to step this way, sir&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here the shopman started, for Danvers had
vanished.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, turning to one of his men,
"if this aint a rum start! Here's our Mr.
Danvers ordering in furniture, promiscuous
like, and four young gentlemen are going to live
with him. You tot up a tidy lot of things,
Blake, and let me know what the sum total
comes to; four boys, he says, and they are to
be provided for simple. What does this
mean?"</p>

<p>The assistant ran off with a laugh, and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
evening a good-sized bill was entered against
Mr. Danvers' name in Frank's book.</p>

<p>That good little man returned to his home,
and after supper took out his account books.
He looked carefully into his banking account,
found that there stood to his credit about one
hundred and fifty pounds in the local bank,
wondered vaguely what all the furniture would
cost, perceived that he could pay for it, and
then dismissed the subject from his mind. He
sat up late over his translation of Cæsar, and
did excellent work. He forgot all about the
boys, and slept soundly when he went to bed.
On returning to his house the next day at noon,
the circumstance of their speedy advent was
brought painfully home to him, however. A
large furniture van stood outside his modest
door. Danvers kept no servant, and the men
were getting impatient at having to pull the
bell in vain; a crowd of small boys and girls were
collected around the van, and several neighbors
were poking their heads out of the adjacent
windows. Danvers felt a sudden thrill run
through him. He opened the door abruptly,
and told the men to take the things upstairs.</p>

<p>"To what room, sir?" they asked.</p>

<p>"Any room," he answered.</p>

<p>He rushed into his private sanctum, and
locked the door with violence. In this refuge
he had a violent tussle with his temper. The
tramping of strange feet was heard all over the
hitherto silent house. The poor little man sat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
down on the nearest chair, and looked the very
picture of abject misery. He was far too unhappy
even to think of dinner. By and by,
the sounds of alien feet died away. The men
slammed the door behind them, and drove off
in the now empty furniture van; the rabble of
boys and girls melted out of sight. Danvers
was beginning to breathe, when a somewhat
timid ring was heard at the front door. His
smoldering ire burst forth afresh; he strode
to open it with his spectacles on the middle of
his forehead. A stout, elderly woman was
standing on the steps; she dropped a profound
courtesy.</p>

<p>"Your business!" he said abruptly.</p>

<p>"If you please sir, I've come to offer for the
situation."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Seeing as you're expecting company, sir, and
it's known that the place is vacant&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There is no place vacant," interrupted Danvers;
"you can go. I don't require your services."</p>

<p>He slammed the door rudely, and went back to
his parlor.</p>

<p>The stout woman's appearance, however, had
set him thinking; he saw a fresh woe ahead of
him. He had taken steps to furnish a room for
the boys, but who was to cook their breakfast,
and dinner, and supper, and make their beds,
and in short do the sort of things which women,
in his opinion, were sent into the world for?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>"It grows worse and worse," he muttered.
"It simply resolves itself into this: I must not
only have four boys driving me to Bedlam, but
the she element must be introduced into my
house&mdash;a charwoman! To this pass have I come.
'Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher; all is
vanity.'"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.<br />

<small>THE CLEARING OF THE WAY.</small></h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-m.jpg" width="59" height="60" alt="M" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi4">"MAURICE," said Cecil, when her brother
came in to tea that evening, "I have
had a most astonishing visitor."</div>

<p>Maurice colored faintly. It darted
through his mind that Danvers might have
called, but he scarcely thought that fact possible.</p>

<p>"No less a person," continued Cecil, "than
your eccentric master, Mr. Danvers. He came in
here, and stood bolt upright on that spot on the
carpet, and looked as fierce as ever he could at
me, and addressed me as madam."</p>

<p>"Oh, nevermind!" said Maurice. "Danvers
is the best old brick in existence. The fact is, I
thought he might call. What did he say, Cecil?
He came about something, of course?"</p>

<p>"I should rather think he did. Maurice, you
wicked boy, there is a mystery at the back of
this, and you are in it. Oh, you bad, bad,
wicked boy, what does this mean?"</p>

<p>The other lads had not yet put in an appearance.
Cecil and Maurice had the parlor to themselves.</p>

<p>Maurice came up close to his sister, and put
one of his big schoolboy hands on her shoulder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>"Go on, Cecil," he remarked; "tell me what
Danvers said."</p>

<p>"Why, this," said Cecil, "he told me that
he would house you all. 'I'll give them house-room,'
he said,&mdash;his language was so abrupt,
Maurice,&mdash;'beds to sleep in; plenty to eat and
drink.' He repeated twice that he was a dragon
on boys, and that I'd be quit of you; he said
that I was to fix up things with you, and that
you could all go to him to-morrow. Now, what
does this mean?"</p>

<p>"Exactly what he said," replied Maurice,
"and didn't I tell you he was a brick? Now it
will be all right for you."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Why, of course, you can go to Redgarth."</p>

<p>"Maurice, did you know of this? Had you
anything to do with it?"</p>

<p>"Had I anything to do with it?" repeated
Maurice slowly. "Rather. Do you think old
Danvers <i>likes</i> to have boys in his house, and that
this sort of offer was spontaneous? No, I put
the screw on. I scrooged him into a corner last
night, and he had no help for it. He wriggled a
good bit, I can tell you, Ceci, but I had him on
toast, and kept him there until I knew he'd do
what he did do. Now, it's all right, and you
can go to Redgarth."</p>

<p>"But, Maurice, dear, I don't understand."</p>

<p>"Well, you will understand in a minute. I'll
put it to you straight enough. You know we
can't stay here, because of that blessed Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
Rogers and her sleep; and you can't stay here,
because you are wanted at Redgarth. You are
the future ornament of that place of learning,
and they can't do without you another day, so
we fellows have to put up somewhere, and Danvers'
is the place. Danvers lives in a house six
times too big for him. The house was left to
him by his old uncle, the miser. Danvers is our
classical master: he lives within a stone's-throw
of the Grammar School. As he says, he is a
dragon, and we could not be safer anywhere than
with him. We can go to-morrow or the next
day, or any day you fancy. We'll be in the
very lap of learning in Danvers' house, and if
we don't all turn out classical prodigies, it won't
be his fault. Now, Cecil, I see yielding on your
face. I'm not going to have it said that I bearded
old Danvers in his den for nothing."</p>

<p>Cecil's heart was yielding already, but several
questions were yet to be asked and answered.
Would Mr. Danvers see to the health of her
boys? Maurice assured her that her boys were
in such a robust state of existence that no seeing
to was necessary. Would he feed her boys, and
make and mend for them? Maurice said that
they must be great asses if they could not manage
that for themselves.</p>

<p>"In short, we're going," he said; "you can
heap up obstacles as much as you like in your
own mind, Cecil; but we're going. Danvers has
yielded; that's the main point. He'll like us
after a bit; he doesn't think so, but I fancy we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
can do a good lot for the poor old chap. I know
his ways, I always could manage him, and I mean
to go on doing so. What about that letter
you've got to write to Mrs. Lavender?"</p>

<p>"I have written it; it's there. I want you to
post it when you go out."</p>

<p>"What have you said?"</p>

<p>"That I&mdash;Maurice, dear, I could not leave
you."</p>

<p>"Where's the letter?" said Maurice.</p>

<p>"There," said Cecil, hesitation in her tone.</p>

<p>Maurice strode across the room, took the letter,
and threw it into the flames.</p>

<p>"You write over again, the minute you've
finished your tea, and tell her you're very much
obliged, and accept like a good, grateful, little
girl," he said. "That letter has got to get into
the post to-night, and another to Miss Forester,
asking her when she can have you, and your
darling Molly might have a line also. Now,
then, I'm ravenous. Oh, I say, cress and shrimps
for tea!"</p>

<p>While Maurice had been making these rapid
arrangements with regard to his own and Cecil's
future, mysterious noises of a muffled character
had been heard outside the door; the handle had
been tried several times in vain, for Maurice had
long ago taken the precaution to lock himself in
with his sister. Now he abruptly turned the
key.</p>

<p>"Come in, you fellows," he said; "grace first,
and then fall to."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>The three boys entered with a certain amount
of demureness, but the sight of shrimps and
water-cress was too much for their gravity.
Cecil's face was very pale; she was feeling too
excited to eat. The four boys rapidly cleared
the board. When they had finished, Maurice
looked at his sister and spoke.</p>

<p>"I have a bit of news for you, lads," he said.</p>

<p>"Oh, Maurice! perhaps we had better not tell
them to-night," interrupted Cecil.</p>

<p>"Well, we <i>did</i> hear something through the
keyhole," interrupted Jimmy, in a modest tone.
"We took the keyhole turn about, so it was a
little confusing. Perhaps you might as well
finish, Maurice. I think I'm to go to a place
called Redgarth, but I'm not quite sure."</p>

<p>"You shut up, you rascal!" said Maurice.
"You know it's very dishonorable to listen
through keyholes."</p>

<p>"Fudge!" said Jimmy; "we're all one
family. What's good for the goose is good for
the gander. Now, am I to go to Redgarth? and
where is Redgarth? and what am I to do when I
get there? Is it a holiday resort, or a horrid
place where they stuff you with books?"</p>

<p>"Don't take any notice of him, Cecil," said
Maurice. "Now, it's just this, boys&mdash;we four
fellows are going to give our sister, the best
sister in all the world, a chance."</p>

<p>"Hip, hip, hurrah!" shouted Charlie.</p>

<p>"Oh, Charlie, for goodness' sake think of
poor Mrs. Rogers!" interrupted Cecil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>"I can't be thinking of that old beggar forever,"
muttered Charlie.</p>

<p>"Shut up, or I'll box you!" cried Teddy.</p>

<p>"Well," continued Maurice, when the din
had a little ceased, "we are going to give the
best sister in the world a little chance."</p>

<p>"I should think so! fifty, if she'll have 'em,"
said Jimmy.</p>

<p>"Well, we can only do so by denying ourselves."</p>

<p>The three round, schoolboy faces assumed a
blank expression.</p>

<p>"Of course we'll deny ourselves," said
Maurice, springing to his feet; "we're not such
cads as to think of doing anything else, even for
a minute. Cecil is going to Redgarth, because
she has got splendid brains, and her brains must
be trained and filled with the right sort of
stuff."</p>

<p>"That sounds like roley-poley pudding, and
'stuff' is the jam," muttered Jimmy, under his
breath.</p>

<p>But the others were too eager to attend to him.</p>

<p>"Where do <i>we</i> come in?" asked Teddy, in an
anxious voice.</p>

<p>"Oh, we're all right," said Maurice, in a lofty
tone; "we're going to put up at old Danvers'."</p>

<p>This news was so absolutely astounding that
the three boys were dumb for a minute.</p>

<p>"I say, you're joking," said Jimmy then.</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it. Danvers can take us in; we
go there next week."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>"But he's so jolly&mdash;so jolly <i>queer</i>," said
Charlie; "you can't mean it, Maurice? Danvers
hates boys, except in school, and then he's
always jacketing them. Danvers is a classic,
and I've no turn for classics. It&mdash;it'll kill me,
Maurice."</p>

<p>"What a cad you are to think of yourself!"
said Maurice; "it won't kill you any more than
the rest of us. I'm glad you've got more stuff
in you, Jimmy, and Teddy knows better than to
stand in his sister's light. Come along out, all
three of you; we'll thrash the thing bare, and
come back prepared to help Cecil in every way.
Ceci, see you get those three letters written.
Now, lads, out you come."</p>

<p>Maurice drove his boys in front of him, and
was soon seen walking quickly down the street
with them. Teddy and Jimmy were in their
hearts just as miserable as Charlie, but as
Maurice seemed to take it for granted that they
intended to behave in a very noble way, they
thought it as well to live up to their supposed
characters.</p>

<p>Cecil, from her window, watched them as they
went down the street.</p>

<p>Yes, she was going to Redgarth now, really
going; the dream of her life was to be fulfilled;
the last obstacle had been rolled away. She
would acquire learning, she would gain certificates,
she would win honors. By and by, she
could take her rightful place in that brilliant
world of letters and literature to which her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
exceptional talents entitled her. Nevertheless,
at this happy moment Cecil Ross shed the
bitterest tears of her whole life.</p>

<p>"Oh, my boys, my boys!" she moaned.
"Oh, Maurice, darling, I do trust you are not
too good to live!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.<br />

<small>TREACHERY.</small></h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-i.jpg" width="60" height="60" alt="I" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi2">"I DON'T believe it for a moment!" said
Kate O'Connor.</div>

<p>"Well, of course, it may be exaggerated,"
replied Hester Temple; "and
I, for my part, have no opinion at all of that
mean little Matilda Matthews; still my feeling
is, that there is never smoke without fire, and&mdash;&mdash; Why,
what is the matter, Kate?"</p>

<p>"Don't say another word!" answered Kate.
"I am in a temper, and you are making it much
worse. I took such an awful fancy to Molly;
but if she is that sort,&mdash;if she really pretends
to be your friend, and abuses you behind your
back,&mdash;why, I shall have nothing more to do
with her."</p>

<p>"You won't require to have much more to do
with her," replied Hester. "You know, don't
you, that her great friend, Miss Ross, is coming
this afternoon? I saw Molly with a wild gleam
of excitement in her eyes this morning, and when
I asked her if she were threatened with softening
of the brain, she replied: 'She's coming;
she's really coming to-night!' and then went off,
singing to herself in quite an idiotic style. You
will have to give up your snug little corner in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
her room, <i>chérie</i>. I wonder where you'll go
now."</p>

<p>"As if that mattered!" replied Kate. "Do
you think that sort of thing troubles me?"</p>

<p>"Why, Kate, I thought it did, quite awfully.
You are the girl who has made all the fuss about
the Dwellers in Cubicles. You invented the
odious phrase, and now it's running like wildfire
all over the place. What do you mean by not
caring? Of course you care."</p>

<p>"Yes, of course, I care," answered Kate, in a
meditative voice. "Molly was a dear little
thing; at least I thought her a dear little thing.
You really can't think how unselfish she was.
She gave me two drawers in her writing table for
my exercises and translations; and she used to
sit bundled up near the window, while I occupied
the place of honor by her table. She said in such
a pretty way: 'You know, Kate, I'm not working
for a scholarship, and you are. I am only
having an all-round sort of time, and I can work
up my notes quite well here, so do have the table.
I wish so much you would.' Of course I took the
little thing at her word, for she has a wonderfully
honest, downright sort of expression."</p>

<p>"It's hopeless to go by that sort of thing in
life," replied Hester, in a gloomy voice.</p>

<p>"So it seems; but I hate learning the wickedness
of the world. Look here! I don't believe
that story of yours."</p>

<p>"You needn't, my dear; I'm half sorry I told
you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>"The best thing would be to clear it up,"
continued Kate, in a thoughtful voice. "I could
go straight to Molly and get her to confront
Matilda, and find out the truth. That girl ought
to be well shamed; she's a disgrace to the school.
If Miss Forester knew her real character, she'd
expel her; I'm sure she would."</p>

<p>"She's a hateful girl," responded Hester;
"and the worst of it is, she's certain to come
here at the half term. She's not really stupid,
you know, and she has been working herself up,
for she's quite mad to get admitted to St.
Dorothy's."</p>

<p>"The place won't be worth living in when she
comes," replied Kate. "There, don't keep me
now, Hester; if that divinity of Molly's is really
coming to-night, I must take my things out of
her room, and if she is the sort of girl you describe
her, I'd rather do so when she's not
there."</p>

<p>"Then you won't clear the thing up?" said
Hester, in a somewhat anxious tone.</p>

<p>"Not to-night, anyway; I'll sleep on it. The
fact is, I've a frightful lot of work to get through
before I can close my eyes in natural sleep."</p>

<p>"Poor old thing!" replied Hester; "I wish I
could give you a corner of my room, but I can't
manage two chums, and the Denbigh girls never
give me a moment to myself."</p>

<p>Hester nodded and walked away, and Kate
went slowly upstairs. There was a slight frown
between her dark brows. She pushed her frizzy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
wild Irish hair back from her forehead. Her
rosy lips wore firmly set. She approached Molly's
door and knocked; her knock had a decidedly
aggressive sound. There was no one inside to
listen to it, and she presently opened the door
and went in. She had just unlocked her own
private drawer in Molly's writing-table, and removed
her exercise books and translations, when
Molly herself quickly entered the room.</p>

<p>"Oh, is that you, Kate?" she exclaimed;
"dear old Kate, I am so dreadfully sorry on your
account."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't mention it, pray," answered Kate,
in a cold voice. "I always knew that I was only
here on sufferance."</p>

<p>"Well, I can't help being glad about Cecil,"
answered Molly. "I'd like so much to tell you
something of Cecil's story. If you knew what
she is, and what she has to do, you could not
help taking an interest in her. Do come over to
the sofa and let us have a chat, won't you?"</p>

<p>"No, thanks; I'm a great deal too busy."</p>

<p>Kate kept her eyes lowered. She would not
permit herself to glance at Molly, whose caressing
tone was softening her in spite of herself.
Had she yielded to her better nature, she would
have rushed up to her friend, repeated Matilda
Matthews' cruel and unkind words, and much
after-trouble and misery would have been
averted. But Kate, notwithstanding her brightness
and good-nature, had a strong vein of obstinacy
in her character. She was very affectionate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
but she had also a great deal of pride, and
that pride was cut to the quick by the words
which Hester had repeated to her.</p>

<p>"I can't stay now, thanks," she went on; "I
have to work up my notes of the lectures I heard
this morning, and have not a minute to spare."</p>

<p>"But Kate, Kate, dear!" cried Molly.</p>

<p>Kate had now approached the door; she turned
on hearing Molly's voice.</p>

<p>"Yes, what is it?" she exclaimed; "I wish
you wouldn't keep me!"</p>

<p>"I won't more than a minute or two. Perhaps
you don't know that Cecil Ross has got the
cubicle next to you in dormitory A."</p>

<p>"Has she? I'm afraid that does not affect me
particularly."</p>

<p>"Oh, but I thought&mdash;I hoped&mdash;&mdash; Kate, what
is the matter?"</p>

<p>"Nothing."</p>

<p>"Then you will be good to her, won't you,
Kate? She's never been at a big school of this
kind before."</p>

<p>"She must take her chance," replied Kate.
"It strikes me she won't be so badly off with
you to be her champion."</p>

<p>"Of course, I'll be her champion," replied
Molly, her face turning crimson, for she began to
be really angry at last.</p>

<p>"Then if you're so afraid for the comfort of
the precious thing, why don't you give up your
room, and sleep in the cubicle next me in dormitory
A? My manners may not be refined, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
I may not be a real lady, and my poverty may
make it essential for you to be kind to me;
nevertheless&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Kate, Kate, I won't stand this!" cried the
astonished Molly. "What in the wide world do
you mean? You speak and look as if you were
angry about something; you speak and look as
if you were angry with <i>me</i>&mdash;with me, who love
you so! What is it? You must and shall tell
me."</p>

<p>But Kate O'Connor's only reply was to slam
the door of Molly's room with violence, and rush
away up to her own dormitory.</p>

<p>There she flung her exercise books and translations
on her little dressing-table, threw herself
down upon her bed, and burst into floods of
bitter weeping.</p>

<p>"Oh, she can't have said it!" she groaned to
herself; "she looked so sweet, and she seemed
so astonished when I threw those taunting words
at her. And yet&mdash;and yet, no one else knows;
I have never confided my real story to anyone
but Molly Lavender. Matilda is a wretch, but
she could not have invented all this. Yes, there
must be some truth in it; and if Molly is that
sort of girl, I will never, never, have anything
more to do with her. All the same, I'm miserable,
for I was beginning to love her as I have
loved no one else since I left dear old Ireland.
Oh, dear, dear, if I were only back in the old
time! Think of home in the summer, the cows,
Cusha, Bess, Star, Whiteface; don't I see them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
now walking slowly up the valley with the evening
sun behind them, and their dear old tails
switching, and grandfather standing by the
hedge at the corner of the lane, and crying
'Kate, Kate, come along and watch the milking!'
Oh, yes! I was happy in those days; I
had no ambition then, only to be the fleetest
runner, and the best swimmer, and the best rider
of any girl in the country round. Oh, for a
gallop now on Black Beauty's back! oh, for a
sniff of the mountain air! oh, for a taste of the
buttermilk and scones at supper time by grandfather's
side! Well, it's all over; he's in his
grave, and the cows are sold, and so is the old
house, and the place belongs to strangers, and
there was just enough money left to educate
Kate O'Connor, and turn her into a fine lady.</p>

<p>"A fine lady! How I hate the term! I
declare I think I'll go to-morrow and tell every
single girl in this house all about myself. How
once I ran about barefooted, and how I used to
know a great deal more about making butter
than about Greek and Latin, and how my one
gift was, just that I could sing like a bird, and
whistle so well that the little wild birds themselves
would come out of the hedges and cock
their bright eyes at me, and whistle, too, when I
lured them long enough. I'd like to tell them
all&mdash;all those conceited girls&mdash;that I'm not
ashamed of the old days, and that I'd rather be
back in them than be the very grandest of them
all. Oh, Molly, I did think you were faithful to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
me! I remember your face when I told you
something of the old life; how soft your eyes
grew, and you held my hand and pressed it a
little, and then you said you wished you could
write a poem about it. But you are a traitor,
Molly Lavender, and you <i>told!</i> You must have
told, for no one else knows. Granted even that
you didn't say the horrid things which Matilda
Matthews accuses you of saying, you are a traitor,
and I'll never be your friend again as long as I
live."</p>

<p>"Kate," called a voice near her ear from the
other side of her dormitory, "did you not hear
the supper gong?"</p>

<p>"No, bless you! has it rung?" called Kate,
springing to her feet.</p>

<p>She hastily smoothed and tidied her hair, put
on a white blouse, and ran downstairs, looking
handsomer and more <i>débonnaire</i> than ever, because
her cheeks were slightly flushed, and her
eyes all the brighter on account of the tears she
had shed.</p>

<p>Kate O'Connor's table was the most popular in
the dining-hall. Since Molly's arrival at St.
Dorothy's, her place had been at Kate's left
hand. By Molly's side now, on this occasion,
sat a slim girl in black. Kate noticed her the
very instant she entered the room.</p>

<p>"Behold the divinity!" she said, under her
breath.</p>

<p>She sat down in her accustomed place by the tea-tray,
and studiously avoided Molly's brown eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>"Kate!" whispered Molly, in an anxious tone.</p>

<p>"What is it, Molly Lavender?" replied Kate,
with some irritation. "Oh, I'll attend to you
presently."</p>

<p>"I want to introduce you to Cecil Ross. Cecil,
this is my friend, Kate O'Connor."</p>

<p>Kate raised her eyes, and encountered for the
first time Cecil's grave, full glance. She found
herself coloring high. Instead of her usual
frank and hearty rejoinder, she now gave a somewhat
stiff bow, and immediately turned her attention
to the requirements of the tea-table.</p>

<p>Molly went on talking to Cecil. As she did
so, she smothered a faint sigh. All day long
she had been looking forward to the evening.
When she had awakened that morning she said
to herself that the happiest day of her life had
dawned. Cecil had arrived at last. Cecil was
by her side, but Molly felt uncomfortable, hurt,
and astounded. What was the matter with
Kate? Molly's quick eyes had taken in the
traces of recent tears on Kate's fair face. Was
it possible that anyone so frank, so good, so
noble, could stoop to so mean a thing as jealousy?
Was it really possible that Kate was
jealous, and of Cecil, Molly's oldest, lifelong
friend?</p>

<p>"If she would only listen to me," thought
Molly to herself, "I would tell her Cecil's story.
She could not but love her, if she knew all that
Cecil has had to undergo; if she knew how
brave and dear Cecil really is. I did so hope<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
that Kate and Cecil would be great friends, and
now Kate is going to be really horrid. What
can it possibly mean?"</p>

<p>The supper that evening was, therefore, at
Kate's table, a constrained and unhappy affair.
Molly was too anxious to be at her best. Cecil
was feeling shy and lonely. She was very glad
to be at St. Dorothy's, and delighted to find herself
by Molly's side; but her thoughts were back
with the boys. She was missing Jimmy's fun
and nonsense; her heart was aching for Maurice,
with his thoughtful face and dear, manly ways.
She was wondering if the boys were as lonely as
she felt, and almost regretting that she had taken
the great step which was now irrevocably accomplished.</p>

<p>"You are tired, Cecil," said Molly, glancing
at her friend.</p>

<p>"My head aches a little," she replied, in a low
tone. "Do you think I may go to bed after
supper, Molly?"</p>

<p>"Of course you may. We'll ask Miss Leicester,
and I'll come up with you to your cubicle
and help you to unpack."</p>

<p>"Will you? That will be very nice."</p>

<p>Molly and Cecil had a long talk in the little
cubicle in dormitory A. Kate, who came upstairs
presently, heard them whispering together
through the wooden partition. Twenty-four
hours ago she would have joined them, and in
two minutes, by the quick infection of her own
high spirits, have caused all Cecil's heartaches to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
vanish, and Molly to be the happiest girl in the
world. Now she sat down moodily on a chair in
front of her little dressing-table, and began to
work up her lecture notes. But the task was so
uncongenial that she soon stopped. The soft
voices in the dormitory next her own kept on
their low talk. She could not hear a word they
said, but the noise irritated her. No one
could be more passionate than poor Kate when
she chose. To-night all the worst side of her
character was in the ascendant. She felt as if
she almost hated Molly and her friend. She
moved softly about her cubicle, afraid that the
two girls might hear her. Soft as her movements
were, Molly detected them. She called out a
little timidly for her.</p>

<p>"Is that you, Kate?"</p>

<p>"Yes; what do you want?" replied Kate.
"I am very busy."</p>

<p>"I hope we're not disturbing you," answered
Molly. "My room is quite at your disposal this
evening; there is no one there."</p>

<p>"Thanks! I prefer to remain where I am,"
answered Kate.</p>

<p>Molly's sigh was so profound at this reply
that it could almost be heard through the wooden
partition. She bade Cecil "good-night," and a
few moments later went downstairs to her own
room. Kate heard Cecil then moving very
quietly about in her cubicle. All her instincts
of chivalry and hospitality urged her to go to the
strange girl in order to offer her services, or at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
least to assure her of her friendship and sympathy.</p>

<p>"She has a nice face," thought Kate to herself.
"Nice! it's more than nice. What a splendid
forehead she has! and her eyes have a keen,
strong look in them! Then, how clever her
mouth is; so firm, and proud, and self-reliant. I
don't wonder Molly likes her. Yes, she has
heaps of character. I expect she'll take the lead
of us all. She is the sort of girl I ought to hold
out the right hand of fellowship to, and I can't&mdash;I
can't, because she is Molly's friend, and Molly
is a traitor. There, my lectures must go to
Hong-Kong to-night; I don't care if I do get
into a row to-morrow. Is life worth living, after
all? What is the use of anything when there's
no constancy and no honor in the world? Who
would have thought that Molly, of all people,
was a traitor?"</p>

<p>The other girls came up into the dormitory.
Julia Hinkson, whose cubicle was at Kate's left
side, knocked on the wall, and made other tokens
of her affectionate presence.</p>

<p>"You can't come in to-night," called Kate,
"I have a headache, and wish to go to bed."</p>

<p>"Oh, what a bother! I had a lot to tell you,"
exclaimed Julia.</p>

<p>"I wonder if she has heard it, too," thought
Kate to herself.</p>

<p>She made no reply to Julia, but got quickly
into bed. After a long time, she fell asleep.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.<br />

<small>THE SUMMERHOUSE.</small></h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-a.jpg" width="59" height="60" alt="A" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi3">A &nbsp;&nbsp;NIGHT'S sleep refreshed Kate, and she
awoke the next morning in a much
better temper with herself and the rest
of the world. She now resolved not to
be too rude to Molly, to cultivate Cecil Ross'
acquaintance up to a certain point, and, if possible,
to get the exact truth out of Matilda.
She went down, therefore, to breakfast looking
somewhat like her usual self. Molly quite
cheered up when Kate nodded to her and asked
Cecil a few questions with regard to the sort of
night she had had, and also her prospects for the
day.</div>

<p>"I feel a little nervous, of course," answered
Cecil; "but I long to know Miss Forester.
From all I have heard of her, she must be a wonderful
woman."</p>

<p>"Miss Forester is about the cleverest woman
in the north of England," answered Kate, with a
little ring of her old enthusiasm in her voice.</p>

<p>"Oh, Kate, how good you were to me my first
day at school!" exclaimed Molly.</p>

<p>Kate looked at her fixedly, and her brows
darkened.</p>

<p>"Of course; it is one's duty to be kind to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
strangers," she said, in a careless tone. "Your
friend, Miss Ross, will have no trouble at all,
Molly, for you'll take her under your wing,
and everyone knows that you are a prime
favorite with Miss Forester."</p>

<p>"Why do you call Cecil Miss Ross?" said
Molly; "and why&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She stopped abruptly. Her frank but troubled
eyes asked whole volumes of questions,
but her lips were silent. Kate felt touched in
spite of herself.</p>

<p>"The right thing would be to go straight to
Molly and tell her everything," whispered conscience
in her breast.</p>

<p>But she would not listen to it.</p>

<p>"If Molly is mean enough to repeat my
greatest confidences, she may go," thought the
proud girl. "She is all right now; she has got
her dearest friend. She does not want me any
longer. Catch me ever telling her anything
private again. Of course she told, for no one
else knows. Matilda could not have invented
the story. Yes, Julia, what is it?"</p>

<p>"Can I see you for a moment after prayers,
Kate?" asked Julia Hinkson.</p>

<p>"If you have anything important to say. I
never looked at my notes last night, and want
to work them up a little before lecture."</p>

<p>"I won't keep you five minutes; I&mdash;&mdash; The
fact is, there is something you ought to know."</p>

<p>"Very well; I will speak to you in the hall,"
answered Kate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>The girls had now to go into the dining room
for prayers. This short service over, Molly
hurried her friend upstairs, and Kate and Julia
found themselves alone in the entrance hall.</p>

<p>"Now, out with it, Julia, for I am in an
awful hurry," said Kate.</p>

<p>"It's only fair you should know," said Julia.
"You've been so kind to Molly Lavender."</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, dear,"&mdash;Kate put her hand to her
forehead,&mdash;"why will people harp on my kindness
to poor Molly? It strikes me that she has
been the kind one to me. Now, what have you
got to say, Julia?"</p>

<p>"Only that if I were you," said Julia, "I
would not repeat things too much to a girl of
that sort."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>Kate's face became crimson.</p>

<p>"Dear me, Kate, how mad you look!"
exclaimed Julia. "I don't think I'll say any
more. You can take a hint, can't you?"</p>

<p>"No, I can't! I hate hints," answered Kate.
"Out with the whole thing this minute, Julia.
What have you to say against Molly? What
confidence has she betrayed?"</p>

<p>"Matilda is the one who told me. Matilda
is making the greatest use of it: she's telling
everybody all over the school."</p>

<p>Kate's brow was now as black as thunder.</p>

<p>"Oh, Kate, Kate, don't look so awful! you
terrify me, you really do."</p>

<p>"What has she been saying?" asked Kate.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
She clutched Julia by her shoulder as she
spoke.</p>

<p>Julia was rather a coward, and she shrank
when she found herself in Kate's firm grip.</p>

<p>"Tell me at once what Matilda has been saying
about me?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, Kate, you do frighten me so awfully!"</p>

<p>"All right; come along this minute to Molly
Lavender's room; perhaps she'll explain if you
won't."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll tell, if you don't look so frightful,
and if&mdash;if you'll promise not to betray me."</p>

<p>"Of course I won't betray you, you little
coward; I am not that sort. Now, then, out
with it!"</p>

<p>"Well, then, Kate&mdash;&mdash; Oh, dear, dear, how
your eyes do flash! Of course I don't believe
it, Kate, not for a minute. Matilda says that
Molly told her. Kate, I wish you wouldn't
pinch me so. Molly told her that&mdash;that you
are not&mdash;of course you <i>are</i>&mdash;but Molly told
Matilda that you are not a lady; you used to
be a dairymaid, and you didn't wear shoes and
stockings, and you are awfully poor. Oh, Kate,
of course it's a lie! but she says that you are
here on charity."</p>

<p>"That will do," said Kate; "you have said
quite enough. Now, of course, I'm not going
to betray you. Get along with you, and
keep it dark that you told me a word of all
this."</p>

<p>"But you don't suppose I believe it, Kate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
dear. You will give me leave to contradict it,
won't you? They are all talking about it."</p>

<p>"Let them talk," said Kate.</p>

<p>"But I may contradict it, may I not?"</p>

<p>"<i>No!</i>"</p>

<p>"Then it is&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is nothing; you may not contradict it;
it is not your affair. Go now, and keep your
own counsel. Be off, and leave me alone."</p>

<p>As Kate uttered these last words, she gave
Julia a little push. Julia was only too glad to
leave the angry girl to herself.</p>

<p>Matilda Matthews was having a very good
time in one of the tennis courts that afternoon.
The tennis season was nearly over; the weather
was getting even more than autumnal. Matilda
was by no means an active girl; she disliked
games almost as much as she disliked study.
She was not a favorite in the ordinary sense of
the word. Nevertheless, girls like Matilda can
exercise a considerable influence over certain
orders of mind. Matilda was the acknowledged
scandalmonger of the school. Her tidbits of
information, although, as a rule, by no means
savory, were often highly seasoned. She had
the reputation of setting more girls by the ears,
of destroying more friendships, than anyone else
in the place. Still it was thought best by the prudent
members of the school to keep on Matilda's
right side. Her friendship was not really valued,
but it was considered safer than her enmity.</p>

<p>From the first day of her arrival, Matilda had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
taken a violent dislike to Molly Lavender.
Molly had snubbed her, and Matilda could not
stand being snubbed. She looked out, therefore,
for a means of revenge, and an opportunity arose
all too quickly. Matilda was the sort of girl
who could sneak and spy. She had almost a
genius for this sort of dirty work. Her ugly
little person was constantly seen where no one
expected to find her. She cultivated her talents
with assiduity, for by these means she acquired
power over her fellow-students. On a certain
occasion, about a week ago, Kate and Molly had
taken a long walk together. On their return
home they had entered the extensive recreation
grounds which belonged alike to all the houses of
residence. They were both tired, and walking
across the wide field, had entered the little
summerhouse where the cricket bats, tennis
bats, and other implements of sport were kept.
They sat down together, and began to talk.</p>

<p>It was on this occasion that Kate had been
drawn out to speak of her early home. It was
then that she had first mentioned her old grandfather,
the summer evenings, the cows and
horses, and all the precious things of her vanished
childhood. She had spoken with feeling,
and Molly had given her a whole world of sympathy.
Neither of the girls knew that Matilda,
who happened to be alone in this part of the
grounds, had crept to the back of the summerhouse,
and deliberately listened to their conversation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>The summerhouse was built of wood; there
was a hole in a certain notch, and to this hole
Matilda applied her rosy ear. She heard everything,
and metaphorically clapped her hands
with delight. Now, indeed, she was possessed
of a dangerous weapon. It was within her
power to sever a friendship which she detested,
and to humble proud Kate O'Connor in the eyes
of all her companions. Matilda was too clever
not to go warily to work. It would never do for
the girls of the school to find out that she had
gained her information by eavesdropping; she
must draw Molly out to drop a hint or two with
regard to Kate. By the aid of this hint, and her
own perfect knowledge, Matilda could soon set
a ball of gossip and ill-will rolling through the
place.</p>

<p>The next day, at lecture, she tried to make
herself agreeable to Molly. She was generally
so spiteful that the change in her conduct could
not but be hailed with relief.</p>

<p>"How splendidly you are getting on!" said
Matilda, when the lecture had come to an end.
"I did not think you would at first, but now I
see that you are very clever."</p>

<p>"That is not the case," answered Molly, in her
blunt way. "I have simply got the most average
abilities; but the fact is, a girl must be very
stupid who does not improve in the atmosphere
of such a place as this."</p>

<p>"You talk like a book," said Matilda.
"Well, there is one thing I do envy you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>"What is that?" asked Molly.</p>

<p>"Your friendship with Kate O'Connor."</p>

<p>"Do you?" replied Molly. "I am glad you
can appreciate her; there is not a girl in the
school like her."</p>

<p>"I will tell you what I think about her," said
Matilda slowly. She avoided Molly's eyes as she
spoke. "She is so completely out of the common
that she must have had quite an uncommon
life. I should not be a bit surprised if she were
one of those brave girls who have known poverty,
and have risen above it. I should call her, if I
were asked, one of nature's ladies. After all,
nature does make noble, queen-like sort of women
now and then, whatever their position in life. Is
that not true, Molly Lavender?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it is perfectly true," answered Molly,
wondering at Matilda's discernment. "There is
no one in the school I respect like Kate."</p>

<p>"Do you think I have gauged her character
correctly?" asked Matilda, in her softest tones.</p>

<p>"You have, Matilda, quite wonderfully."</p>

<p>"She is one of nature's ladies, is she not?"</p>

<p>"Indeed she is."</p>

<p>"She has known poverty, and has risen above
it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, she has had a noble life," answered
Molly. "I am so glad you appreciate her."</p>

<p>"I long for her friendship," said Matilda, with
a sigh; "but alas! it is not for me; she would
despise a girl of my sort."</p>

<p>"Not if you lived up to her," said Molly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
turning round and gazing full at Matilda's low-class
face.</p>

<p>Something in the expression of the bad girl's
eyes caused Molly to recoil and draw into her
shell. But she had said quite enough for
Matilda's purpose, and the scandal which was to
wreck a beautiful friendship began to circulate
through the school on that very afternoon.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.<br />

<small>KATE'S LITTLE PLAN.</small></h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-a.jpg" width="59" height="60" alt="A" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi3">AFTER morning lectures on the first day
of Cecil Ross' arrival at Redgarth,
Kate O'Connor walked suddenly into
the classroom where Matilda was putting
up her books. As a rule, Kate did not
take the slightest notice of Matilda. Now she
walked straight to her side, and asked if she
were going back to dinner.</div>

<p>"Yes," replied Matilda, drawing up her little
squat person, and trying to look imposing and
not frightened; for Matilda, like many other
people of her special genus, could be a rare
coward on certain occasions. "Yes," she said;
"why not?" She tried to throw a pert tone
into her voice.</p>

<p>"Why not, of course," replied Kate, standing
very upright, and tall, and handsome by her side.
"I also am going back to dinner, and as our
road home lies part of the way together, shall
we start at once?"</p>

<p>"But you don't really want to walk with me?"
said Matilda, shrinking back.</p>

<p>"On this occasion I happen to wish to walk
with you," said Kate. "I have something to
ask you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh!"</p>

<p>Matilda's freckled face became mottled. She
stooped down under the pretense of tying her
shoe.</p>

<p>"I am in a great hurry," she said. "Will not
this afternoon do?"</p>

<p>"No, it will not do. I shan't take up any of
your valuable time. I shall simply walk with
you across the quadrangle. Now, come on, or
some other girls will join us."</p>

<p>"But I promised to walk with Rosy Merton."</p>

<p>"Rosy Merton must look for another companion.
Come, Matilda, I shall think you have
reasons for shirking my society if you make any
more excuses."</p>

<p>"How could you possibly think that?" said
Matilda, with a little nervous laugh. "Everyone
knows that to be seen walking with Kate
O'Connor is a distinction."</p>

<p>Kate made no response.</p>

<p>"Are you ready?" she said.</p>

<p>Matilda shouldered her bag of books, and the
two girls left the school together.</p>

<p>Several curious pairs of eyes saw them go, and
the news began to circulate through the class
room that Matilda was going to get her deserts
from Kate. Matilda's story with regard to Kate
was now known to every girl at St. Dorothy's.
They listened to the envious, wicked girl's spiteful
words with avidity, disliking her cordially all
the time, and feeling rather more interested in
Kate than they had done hitherto.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>Julia Hinkson was one of the girls who saw the
pair walk off together, and Julia felt her heart
sink down into her boots, as she expressed it.</p>

<p>"Now," said Kate, when they had got beyond
the school precincts, "I want to ask you a very
plain question, Matilda. Oh, you need not turn
away, for I am determined to ask it! Pray
slacken your steps; there is no hurry."</p>

<p>"There is. I have a great lot of work to get
through," mumbled Matilda. "I thought I
could get five minutes before dinner to work up
my French verbs. I am going to try for the governors'
scholarship, you know, Kate."</p>

<p>Kate made no response for a minute. Then
she said in a slow, deliberate voice, which she
scarcely recognized as her own: "I am not interested
in your studies, Matilda; if I know anything
about you, your path and mine in life will
always be far apart. I have asked you to walk
with me to-day because I have heard a report
which troubles me very much. About three
weeks ago I happened to tell certain facts with
regard to my early life to my friend, Molly
Lavender. The story I told her has now, it
appears, become common property at St. Dorothy's.
More than one girl has told me this. No,
excuse me, I do not intend to mention names. In
each case I am told that you are responsible for
the report which has been circulated about me;
I am told, further, that you have got your information
from Molly. I want to know if this is
the case."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>Matilda did not speak at all for a moment.</p>

<p>"Is it true, Matilda?"</p>

<p>"Why do you ask me?" replied Miss Matthews,
giving her fat shoulder a little shrug.
"Your action and manner tell me all too plainly
that you have not a spark of respect for me. If
I were to tell you, would you believe me?"</p>

<p>It was now Kate's turn to be silent.</p>

<p>"If you do not intend to believe me, what is
the use of my speaking?" continued Matilda.</p>

<p>"On this occasion I think I must believe you,"
answered Kate.</p>

<p>"Very well; repeat your question."</p>

<p>"Did you hear the report about me from Molly
Lavender?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Kate felt herself turning pale. A cold dew
stood out on her forehead; she pressed her hand
with a quick movement to her heart.</p>

<p>"I said I'd believe you," she answered, after a
pause. "I will not press for further confidence.
Our roads divide here. Good-morning!"</p>

<p>Kate rushed off to St. Dorothy's.</p>

<p>She appeared at dinner with flushed cheeks and
bright eyes. Her manner had undergone a complete
revolution. She was no longer stiff nor
defiant. She addressed herself almost as much
as formerly to Molly, who received her first advances
with delight, but presently turned away
her head with a sigh. This voluble, excitable
Kate was not the Kate O'Connor of old. A certain
element which had made her slightest remark<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
delightful had left her voice. Molly thought, as
she listened to her gay and excited words, that
she would rather have her silent and distant.
But Cecil, who did not know Kate, and the other
girls at the dinner table were charmed to have
her bright and cheerful once more.</p>

<p>When the meal came to an end, Kate rushed
off to find Miss Leicester.</p>

<p>"I want to ask a great favor of you, Miss
Leicester," exclaimed the girl.</p>

<p>"What is that, my dear?"</p>

<p>"My birthday will be on Saturday. I shall be
seventeen on that occasion; I want to know if I
may celebrate the event by a little party, to which
I want to ask all my friends and acquaintances
belonging to the school."</p>

<p>Miss Leicester considered for a moment.</p>

<p>"We don't much care to have entertainments
of that sort during term," she said.</p>

<p>"Yes; but this is a most special occasion. I
do beg of you to let me have it."</p>

<p>"Where do you propose to entertain your
friends, Kate?"</p>

<p>"I think Hester Temple will let me use her
room; it is a good large one."</p>

<p>"My dear, I can't, of course, really object.
You want to have a little supper?"</p>

<p>"Yes; if I may."</p>

<p>"You may, Kate; you are a good girl; we all
like you, and I am not going to refuse the first
request you have ever asked me."</p>

<p>"Thank you a thousand times! How truly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
kind you are! Will you add to the favor you
are conferring on me by being one of my
guests?"</p>

<p>"If you really wish it, of course, my dear;
but will it not spoil the fun?"</p>

<p>"I don't think there will be much fun."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Will you come, Miss Leicester? I really
can't explain myself."</p>

<p>"Kate, you don't look happy. Is anything
the matter, my dear child?"</p>

<p>"You will know if you come on Saturday.
Of course there is nothing the matter&mdash;I mean
nothing of consequence. Please come! I am
Irish; I am subject to moods&mdash;to many moods."</p>

<p>"Yes, I will come, Kate. Have you got
money for your little entertainment?"</p>

<p>"I have an unbroken sovereign in my purse&mdash;more
than enough. Thank you a thousand
times for giving me leave."</p>

<p>Kate went off with her head in the air. She
met Hester coming downstairs.</p>

<p>"Hetty," she cried, running up to her, "I
am going to have a birthday on Saturday!"</p>

<p>"Are you indeed, Kate? and how bright you
look!"</p>

<p>"Why not? Have you any objection?"</p>

<p>"No, I am sure I have not," replied Hester
heartily. "I am only too delighted. I felt like
cutting out my tongue, Katy, for having
told you what I did last night."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't bother myself with reports like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
that!" replied Kate, in a low tone. "Most
people have gossip spread about them."</p>

<p>"Then you are not going to quarrel with
Molly Lavender?"</p>

<p>"Quarrel with her? Certainly not. Hetty,
I want to ask you a favor."</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"I want to celebrate my birthday."</p>

<p>"Indeed, lucky you! have you got money?"</p>

<p>"Yes; an unbroken sovereign. I mean to
give a feast."</p>

<p>"Delicious! Bon-bons, do you mean?"</p>

<p>"More than bon-bons. I thought of lemonade,
sandwiches, ginger-beer, chocolate, cakes."</p>

<p>"Nectar for the gods!" cried Hester, with
enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"I spoke to Miss Leicester, and she has given
me permission," continued Kate.</p>

<p>"Oh, the angel!" exclaimed Hester. "Then
it is not going to be a case of stolen sweets;
eh, Kate?"</p>

<p>"No; it is to be all rectitude, noble example,
true hospitality; the most aboveboard sort of
thing in existence."</p>

<p>"It won't be such fun as if there were a little
spice of wickedness in it," quoth Hester.</p>

<p>"Hetty, you shock me! I shall be seventeen
on Saturday. At seventeen one ought to discard
wickedness as one would a worn-out shell."</p>

<p>"All right, love! Of course I approve, but
did you not say that you wanted to ask me
a favor?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>"Rather; I want you to lend me your room
for the great occasion."</p>

<p>"Of course I will; what is more, I will help
you by every means in my power. Of course
Molly is coming to the birthday feast?"</p>

<p>"Of course she is; she is to be one of my
most distinguished guests."</p>

<p>"And that new girl, Cecil Ross?"</p>

<p>"She shall also be invited; Molly shall not
be deprived of her dear friend's society."</p>

<p>"Kate, I am certain you are jealous of Cecil
Ross."</p>

<p>"Furiously jealous," answered Kate, with
a light laugh.</p>

<p>"Oh, but you needn't be! Molly loves you;
she was crying about you this morning."</p>

<p>"What a very unpleasant thing to tell me!"
said Kate. "Am I in such a deplorable condition,
in either mind or body, as to require
tears?"</p>

<p>Hester opened her lips to speak, but Kate
suddenly clapped her hand across her mouth.</p>

<p>"Not a word more, Hetty," she exclaimed;
"I have really no time to consider Molly Lavender's
feelings at the present moment. I mean
to ask all the girls whom I know to my birthday
feast, even Matilda Matthews."</p>

<p>"Oh, that horrid creature! I wouldn't if I
were you."</p>

<p>"You would if you were me."</p>

<p>"But surely you are not going to take up
a girl of that sort?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>"Did I say so?"</p>

<p>"No; but to ask her to your party!"</p>

<p>"That is no special sign of friendship," replied
Kate; "both friends and acquaintances are to
be invited. Well, this is Wednesday, and I
have no more time to spare. I must go to my
cubicle now to write invitations."</p>

<p>Kate ran off.</p>

<p>That afternoon the girls at St. Dorothy's, and
several girls in other houses of residence, received
short letters from Kate O'Connor. The letters
ran as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Kate O'Connor requests the pleasure of your company
to a birthday supper on the twentieth inst., at eight o'clock.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">r.s.v.p.</span>"</p></blockquote>

<p>Molly found her invitation lying on the top of
her bureau; there was one also for Cecil. The
girls began to talk and wonder, but Kate kept
her own counsel. Her eyes were brighter than
usual, and she held herself more aloof than of
old. All the girls to whom the invitations had
been sent longed for Saturday&mdash;all, with the
exception of Matilda Matthews. Matilda was
devoured with curiosity, she was proud of being
invited; but mixed with her pride and her sensations
of curiosity was a strange, incomprehensible
feeling of fear.</p>

<p>So many girls accepted the invitation that
Hester's room was discovered to be quite too
small for the festive occasion. A good-natured
neighbor, however, Lucy Anderson by name,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
came unexpectedly to the rescue. She suggested
that the supper should be in her room, and that
the guests should assemble in Hester's. This
could be easily managed, for the two rooms had
communicating doors. Kate was now very busy,
and Hester became her right hand.</p>

<p>A week ago she would have consulted Molly
with regard to all the arrangements for her birthday
party; now Hester was the favored one.
Kate was in her gayest, most <i>débonnaire</i> mood.
Her Irish wit rose to fever point; she kept those
girls with whom she chose to be intimate in
ceaseless giggles and wild peals of mirth. As
she scattered her <i>bon-mots</i>, she scarcely laughed
herself, but the light in her sparkling eyes was
infectious, and the smiles which came at rare
intervals, and showed her pearly white teeth,
had something fascinating about them. Hester
was alone in the secret with regard to the capacities
of Kate's sovereign. Hester was clever
with regard to the laying out of a limited sum of
money. Between twenty and thirty girls had
accepted Kate's invitation. Girls of the ages of
from fourteen to seventeen are proverbial for
healthy appetites; wise Hester therefore suggested
that the cakes should be plain and abundant,
rather than rich and scanty; that the
lemonade should not be made entirely with fresh
lemons; in short, that several little economies
should be practiced in order to make the feast, if
simple, full and plenty.</p>

<div class="caption">KATE'S PICTURE.</div>
</div>

<p>There was no hitch in the arrangements. Each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
girl was requested to bring her own cup and
saucer, her own spoon, plate, and glass. When
the hour arrived, Hester met the invited guests
at the door, and quickly relieved them of these
little accessories to the feast. Laughter, talk,
and high good-humor marked the auspicious
hour. Kate herself, the acknowledged queen of
the evening, was one of the last to appear. This
fact rather astonished Hester, who, although behind
the scenes in one sense of the word, was
completely in the dark as to Kate's real motive
for calling her friends together. She walked
into Hester Temple's pretty rooms when they
were quite full, and nodded to her assembled
friends with a bright smile and a word of welcome.
Her dress on this occasion annoyed more
than one. It consisted of a cotton blouse and a
short dark-blue serge skirt. The blouse was
slightly old-fashioned in make, and looked as if
it had often visited the washtub. Kate's luxuriant
hair was arranged more simply than on ordinary
occasions, her cheeks were flushed, her eyes
were wonderfully bright; she wore neat black
stockings, and a stout little pair of shoes.</p>

<p>"Dear me, Kate, what a funny costume!" said
Lucy Anderson. "Why, you look exactly as if
you were dressing up to do the part of a dairymaid."</p>

<p>"Well, it's a very good part to do, isn't it?"
said Kate.</p>

<p>She laughed merrily, and, going into the
supper room, began to help Hester in dispensing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
the viands. Matilda Matthews, who was sitting
near one of the doors, looked strangely uncomfortable
when Kate came in; she felt somehow
as if Kate were laughing at her. She did not
like that dairymaid dress, and wondered if she
could quietly escape without anyone noticing
her exit.</p>

<p>The thought had scarcely darted through her
mind before Kate approached her.</p>

<p>"I am so glad to see you," she said; "you
must not sit there by the door; you are a
stranger in this house, and as a stranger, I wish
to show you special attention. Pray come up
and sit here. You won't! Oh, yes, I am sure
you will, to oblige me! Here's our new girl,
Cecil Ross. I will introduce you to Miss Ross;
she is a very distinguished-looking girl, and will
make her mark at St. Dorothy's. You always
like to be in the swim; don't you, Matilda?
Well, you ought to know Cecil. Come, I shall
have pleasure in making you both acquainted
with each other."</p>

<p>Matilda found herself absolutely tongue-tied.
Kate's words were polite enough, but beneath
them she felt the strong and iron will of the
resolute and thoroughly enraged girl. The two
walked across the room together; they made a
striking contrast. The phrase "One of nature's
ladies" darted through more than one girl's
mind as she looked at Kate. Matilda was much
overdressed. She wore a dirty rose-colored silk
blouse, and a tawdry skirt trimmed with quantities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
of cheap lace. Her light hair was frizzed
and distorted out of all grace, her freckled cheeks
were mottled, and her dull eyes were destitute
of life and fire. Cecil rose gravely from her seat
by Molly's side, when Kate brought Matilda up
to be introduced to her.</p>

<p>"Miss Matthews&mdash;Miss Ross," said Kate.
"Matilda Matthews hopes soon to be an inmate
of St. Dorothy's," continued Kate. "You are
the new girl at present, Miss Ross. Matilda
hopes to be in that enviable position at the half
term."</p>

<p>Cecil bowed gravely. Matilda squeezed her
fat person into a chair by her side.</p>

<p>"Did you ever see anyone more plebeian in
your life?" she whispered to Cecil, when Kate
moved off.</p>

<p>This remark slightly relieved her feelings, and
there was a good deal of venom in the tone in
which she uttered it.</p>

<p>"I don't understand you," replied Cecil
gravely.</p>

<p>"Well, I wonder you don't; I suppose I must
explain myself. Our hostess looks like a dairymaid,
<i>n'est ce pas?</i>"</p>

<p>"I am not particularly acquainted with the
appearance of dairymaids," replied Cecil. "I
think our hostess quite the prettiest girl I have
ever seen."</p>

<p>Matilda shrugged her fat shoulders.</p>

<p>"<i>Chacun à son goût</i>," she repeated.</p>

<p>Cecil looked at her in a puzzled way. She felt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
surprised at Kate's going to the trouble of introducing
her to such a girl, and after saying a few
polite words, turned again to talk to Molly.
Molly was in white, and looked one of the
sweetest girls in the room. Her simple white
dress, the innocent, open expression of her face,
gave her something the appearance of a daisy.
Cecil, pale, and in deep mourning, made a strong
contrast to her friend. The festivities of the
evening were now at their height. The girls
laughed and joked, and walked from one room
to the other. Kate was here, there, and everywhere.
The birthday party became so hilarious
that Kate's somewhat peculiar dress was forgotten;
all was eager conversation and high mirth.
Still, Matilda had her own reasons for feeling
uncomfortable. Again and again her eyes
sought the neighborhood of the door. But
whenever she began to make her escape, Kate
was down upon her.</p>

<p>"You are eating nothing, Matilda," she said
on one of these occasions. "Come into the
supper room. Oh, how hot you look! a little
lemonade will do you good. Come in here;
come with me. Hester, will you give Matilda
Matthews a glass of lemonade?"</p>

<p>Hester hurried to comply. As she did so, Kate
stooped to whisper to her:</p>

<p>"I don't want that girl to slip out of the
room," she said. "Watch her; follow her;
keep your eye on her."</p>

<p>"Kate, what is the matter with you?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>"Nothing, nothing! Only keep your eye on
Matilda Matthews."</p>

<p>The supper was over at last; even schoolgirls'
appetites were satisfied.</p>

<p>"Now, then, let's clear the room," cried
Kate.</p>

<p>A few eager hands and legs were immediately
at her service. The trays, piled with plates,
cups and saucers, and glasses, were conveyed
into the passage outside. A moment or two
later Miss Leicester came in. She wore a black
velvet dress with a long train, and looked particularly
dignified and handsome. Kate ran to
the door to bid her welcome.</p>

<p>"How sweet of you to come!" she cried.
"You are just in time for my birthday speech."</p>

<p>"Are you going to make a speech, dear
child?" said Miss Leicester.</p>

<p>"Yes; a little birthday oration. I hope you
won't mind."</p>

<p>"No; I shall be interested to hear what you
have got to say."</p>

<p>Kate led Miss Leicester to the chair of honor.
All the girls had now collected in Hester Temple's
pretty room.</p>

<p>"It is awfully hot," whispered Matilda to her
nearest companion. "For my part, I think this
a very stupid sort of entertainment. The food
was awful. Fancy asking a person to come and
eat seedcake, and that dreadful lemonade made
with tartaric acid. I shall have the stomach-ache
to-night. Don't you think this affair very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
slow, Jenny? What do you say to our going
home?"</p>

<p>"No; I'm enjoying myself," said Jenny
Howe. "Did you hear Kate say that she was
going to make a birthday speech? Kate is such
a bright, clever creature, I am quite longing to
hear what she has got to say. By the way,
Matilda, I don't believe a word of that horrid
story you told me about her."</p>

<p>"Did I say anything?" queried Matilda.
"I'm sure, if I did, I've forgotten all about it.
Of course, I admire Kate O'Connor. She is a
little peculiar, but she can't help that."</p>

<p>"Hush!" said Jenny; "she is going to begin
her speech. Try not to be so spiteful, Matilda."</p>

<p>Matilda flushed more hotly than ever. She
looked in the direction of the door, and made a
sudden dart toward it. Hester Temple was
standing close to it.</p>

<p>"Where are you going?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Home; I am suffocating. This room is too
hot for me."</p>

<p>"I'll open the window, and you can stand
near it. You really can't go now, Matilda; it
would be awfully rude; just when Kate is going
to make her birthday speech."</p>

<p>Matilda looked round her wildly; there was
no means of escape. She resigned herself
sullenly to her fate.</p>

<p>There was a little empty space in the middle
of the room, and into this space Kate now lightly
stepped. She looked around her to right and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
left. Her eyes, bright as stars, met Molly's.
They did not rest a moment on her old friend's
face. From Molly she looked full at Matilda.</p>

<p>"There is a seat in front for you," she said.
"Come forward, Matilda; you are choking, back
there in the crowd. Come and sit near Miss
Leicester."</p>

<p>"Yes, my dear; here is a comfortable chair,
in which you will be quite cool," said Miss
Leicester.</p>

<p>Poor Matilda was dragged unwillingly to the
front. Kate's eyes danced more brightly than
ever, and smiles of delight soon rippled all over
her face.</p>

<p>"It was so kind of you all to come to celebrate
my birthday," she began. "I am seventeen
to-day; quite old for a girl. I have been at
St. Dorothy's exactly a year. It has been a very
happy year to me. I have made a good many
friends. The girls in the house have been particularly
kind to me. I want to thank all the
girls here for their kindness. I want also to say
something else."</p>

<p>Here her manner suddenly changed. The gay
sparkle and fun went out of her face. She
pressed one hand for an instant to her left side;
her eyes, troubled and misty, were fixed on Miss
Leicester's face.</p>

<p>"I think Miss Leicester knows all about me,"
she said. "She knows my origin; she knows
what I was before I came to St. Dorothy's."</p>

<p>"Kate, dear, I would rather you did not allude<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
to that subject," said Miss Leicester, distress
and astonishment in her tone.</p>

<p>"I am very sorry to disobey you, Miss Leicester,
but I have thought it all out, and I think
it is best," replied Kate. "I am ashamed of
nothing. I should like now to describe the life&mdash;the
early life&mdash;of a girl."</p>

<p>Here she looked quickly from one eager face
to the other.</p>

<p>"The girl is myself," continued Kate. "If I
were to shut my eyes now, I should see a picture.
Perhaps I can describe that picture to you with
eyes open. There is a little farm, far, far away
in the west of Ireland. The country is beautiful,
although somewhat wild. The mountains
seem in parts to reach the very sky. Now and
then the clouds come right down and cover them.
The grass is very green, and the streams make a
merry sound as they ripple past the little farmstead.
The house would be thought a poor one
by most of you. It has a thatched roof; there
is a kitchen, and a great open hearth. On the
hearth the fire blazes merrily. A lot of bacon
hangs from the rafters across the ceiling. There
is a deal table in the middle of the room, and a
great dresser at one side. The table is clean and
white, as white as snow. The dresser is white
also, and the plates and cups and saucers, and
jugs and bowls, and the tins and saucepans, all
shine with good washing and good rubbing.
You see, it is a very humble kitchen, and there
is no parlor, nor drawing room, nor any regular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
sitting room in the little old house. Upstairs
there are two bedrooms. You go upstairs by
means of a step-ladder. One of the rooms is
prettier than the other. It has a lattice window,
and there are lots of monthly roses, creepers,
myrtle, and other flowers twining about it. A
sweet smell comes in when you open the window,
and you hear the robins and swallows chirping
in the eaves, and you get a sweet whiff of strong
air from the mountains opposite. The little
room inside is very poor, but the window and
the view without are lovely. The inner room
looks out on the yard or byre. You can see the
cattle from this window; the four cows in their
stalls, and the dairymaid, with her red elbows,
milking them. I am not the dairymaid, but I
go to superintend the milking. At the back of
the kitchen is the dairy. The dairy is lovely;
it is cool and sweet and dark. On the hottest
day in summer you feel a breath of ice on your
cheek when you enter here, and the milk and
cream look good in the large glass pans; and
the churn stands open, waiting to receive its
daily portion of cream; and there are piles of
yellow butter standing on the shelves, and great
dishes of fresh eggs not far away.</p>

<p>"I think I have described the house well
enough to you now. You must see for yourselves
that it is just the sort of place where poor
people would live. The people who live in it are
an old man and a girl. They keep no servant;
they do their own work. There is a dairymaid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
who comes morning and evening to milk the
cows and help the girl with the butter, and there
are two men who help with the land, and that is
all. The old man and the girl have the house to
themselves most of the time. I should like to
describe that old man. He does a lot of rough
work; he lays the fire for the girl day after day,
and fills the kettle for her, and won't allow her
to do anything except the lightest part of the
daily toil; but, for all that, he is quite a gentleman.
I say nothing about the girl. She may
belong, in every sense of the word, to the class
from which she springs, but the old man is a
king in his way. He has a very noble head, and
hair as white as silver. His eyes are dark and
soft, his nose aquiline. When he stands up, he
looks dignified; when he looks at you, you get
a peep at his grand soul.</p>

<p>"That old man is between seventy and eighty
years of age. He has spent his entire life in
one county, and he is known all over the
place. The old people know him, and the young
people, and the children; and there is not an
individual who does not love him. Not an evil
word has ever been flung against him. During
the whole of his long life no one can accuse
him of having ever done a mean thing, of having
oppressed the fatherless and the widow, of
having taken money that did not belong to
him. All during his long life he has lived by
the golden rule, 'Do to others as you would be
done by.' He is not a learned man, but he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
knows his Bible very well, and he can quote
whole pages from Shakspere. He also understands
nature splendidly. It is wonderful to
hear him when he talks about nature's secrets.
There is nothing that grows on the land, or
feeds on the soil, or flies in the air, or lives in
the sea (which is not far away), that this old
man does not know about. He can tell you
about the habits of all the birds, and the ways
of all the fishes, and about the medicinal uses
of a great many herbs, and the food uses of all
the vegetables and the fruits. It is delightful
to hear him when he speaks, for he chooses his
words with grace, and his grammar is perfectly
correct. He has the most beautiful mind the
girl ever came across in the whole course of her
life. It is an idyl and a poem to live with him.</p>

<p>"I must now tell you something of the life of
the girl. She is naturally very fond of books,
but she has not much time for them. She gets
up at five o'clock in the morning, summer and
winter; she is busy from early morning till
early bedtime. There are the cows to see to&mdash;she
loves those cows. She wishes she could
describe to you the look in Cusha's eyes.
Cusha has the most perfect brown eyes of any
creature in all the world. The girl cannot think
of them now without tears coming into her
own. She loves the memory of the other cows,
too, but Cusha comes first. She has even milked
Cusha&mdash;yes, with these hands; look at them.
She and Cusha enjoyed themselves at these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
times. The girl has not only the dairy to see
to and superintend, but she has also the poultry
yard. Do you like fluffy little balls of yellow
chickens? There is nothing vulgar about them,
is there? The girl walked about the yard, and
through the gardens, with the chickens pressed
to her neck, and cuddled in her arms, hundreds
and hundreds of times; and there are the goslings,
almost prettier still. You see for yourselves
that she must have plenty to do.</p>

<p>"She has also the flower garden to see to.
All the mignonette, and the sweet peas, and the
roses; the great hedges of Scotch roses, white
and red, are her care. She lives with her
flowers. The old man talks to her about them
while she tends them. It is strange, but it
seems to me there is nothing vulgar nor commonplace
in her life. She has no time for commonplace
thoughts, nor for slander and gossip,
nor evil speaking. She is not to be praised for
not indulging in these things; she has simply
no time for them. In the evening she studies.
She reads Shakspere and many books of history,
and she always ends up with the Bible.
She goes to bed quite early. Perhaps I have
not half described her life; perhaps also I have
told you enough.</p>

<p>"The girl&mdash;the girl who now stands before
you&mdash;lived this beautiful ideal life until she was
nearly sixteen years of age; then God thought it
right, for reasons of his own, to take it away
from her. The old man, the grand old king of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
the hamlet, was found dead in his bed one morning.
It was a very fitting end for him, and he
was quite ready to go. But the girl! somehow
or other, her heart broke then. She has never
been the same since that dreadful summer's
morning. The sun of her early happy youth
seemed to set for her then, and though the bees
hummed, and the birds sang, and the flowers
bloomed, and all the creatures of the world went
on in their happy way, the girl felt that nothing
could be perfect with her again until she joined
the old man in the land beyond the sea.</p>

<p>"Great troubles came to her after this. Perhaps
some of you here would not have thought
them so. The little old farm, the shabby, dear
old house, had to be sold, and Cusha went to
strangers, and the other cows followed her
example, and the chickens and goslings, and all
the other live stock, even to dear Black Beauty,
the farm horse, who was so sweet and noble that
the girl can't talk about him without tears&mdash;they
were all scattered far and wide, and the girl herself
was left with money in the bank; not much,
but a little. Then she remembered her grandfather,
and she said to herself, 'For his sake I
will stop fretting, and I will make the most I can
out of my life.' She wrote to Miss Forester,
and Miss Forester wrote back, and begged of her
to come to Redgarth. She came, and in the fresh,
glad, full life she tried to drown her sorrow.</p>

<p>"But," continued Kate, stopping abruptly,
and turning with flashing eyes from Molly to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
where Matilda crouched by Miss Leicester's side,
"she can never drown the sorrow which tells her
that the old beautiful life is over. Lately, quite
lately, a report has reached this girl, which for a
day or two drove her nearly mad. There are
certain girls at St. Dorothy's, and at other houses
of residence, who think the ideal life which she
used to live desecration. This fact cut her to
the heart. Perhaps, girls," continued Kate, "I
am not a lady in your acceptation of the word,
but I wish to tell you all to-night, every one of
you, that I would not change with you. I would
not give up that old memory. I would not give
up that near relationship to the grand old king
of that humble hamlet for any you could confer
on me. You know everything now. You can
gossip as much as you like. You can speak
of me as low, as uneducated, as of humble
birth. Do you think I care? No, not now;
now that you know the simple truth. I have
only one word more to say. Among the gossip
which has reached my ears, I am told that I am
the recipient of Miss Forester's charity. I am
quite certain that Miss Forester would give
charity in the kindest and most thoughtful way,
but my grandfather was proud as well as great,
and he left me enough money when he died to
give me all the advantages of this home of learning.
Girls, I may be poor and humble, but I am
<i>not</i> here on charity."</p>

<p>As Kate uttered her last words, she walked
quietly out of the room. She had spoken with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
force; there had been an earnest ring in her
voice, and a look about her eyes which had
caused a queer sensation in the minds of all who
listened to her. When she went toward the
door of the room, no one stirred to call her back;
there was a dead silence. After a time, Miss
Leicester rose to her feet and spoke.</p>

<p>"I am very much surprised at all this," she
said. "Has anyone in this school dared to be
unkind to Kate O'Connor? Has anyone dared
to gossip about her, or laugh about her? No, I
don't expect an answer to-night, for this matter
must be thoroughly investigated."</p>

<p>Then she also left the room.</p>

<p>Her departure was the signal for a perfect
babel of tongues. The girls of St. Dorothy's
were immensely excited. Matilda sought an
opportunity to find her way to the door; no one
noticed her departure now, and she rushed out of
the house trembling a good deal, and glad when
she found herself in the open air. Matilda was a
thorough coward. She perceived at a glance that
the full weight of public opinion would be against
her, if her part in this sorry story were known.</p>

<p>"There is nothing for it now, but for me to
take up Kate O'Connor," she said to herself;
"to make much of her; to consider it the finest
thing in the world to have been a dairymaid and
a peasant girl when you were a child. Kate is
wonderfully clever, and she has scored a point in
her favor. By and by, however, there will come
a reaction, and then my hour will have arrived."</p>

</div>
<div class="drop-capi4">"DO sit down, Molly! Where are you
going?" said Hester Temple.</div>

<p>Molly Lavender paused when Hester
said these words to her.</p>

<p>"I want to find Kate," she said. "There is
something dreadful the matter with Kate. She
looked at me as if she thought I had said something.
Oh, I must go to her; don't keep me."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you had better," said Hester, giving
Molly a queer glance.</p>

<p>Molly ran out of the room. Hester was
dragged down on an ottoman between two of
her friends. They were both excited.</p>

<p>"Do let us talk the thing over!" they said.
"Did you ever know anything so dramatic? and
didn't Kate look charming? I'm sure one
wouldn't mind being a peasant, or a dairymaid,
or anything else, if one could look as she did
just now."</p>

<p>"It wasn't the look so much as the words,"
said a tall, dark girl who stood near. "I scarcely
looked at her, but her words were like a poem.
I never knew anyone choose her language so
well. I suppose she inherits her talent from that
wonderful old man. How I wish I were an artist,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
that I might sketch that scene which she depicted
the old man and the girl! Anyone in
all the world would be proud to be <i>that</i> girl.
Oh, what is it, Miss Ross? Did you speak?"</p>

<p>Cecil had been waiting all this time to find an
opportunity.</p>

<p>"The thing to do," she said, "is this. We
must not waste our time in admiring the beautiful
picture which Miss O'Connor sketched for us;
we must get at the bottom of the mischief which
has been going on. Molly Lavender and Kate
were great friends; now Kate is unkind and
cold to Molly. Did you say anything, Hester?"</p>

<p>"Well, the fact is," said Hester, "I am not
greatly surprised."</p>

<p>"Why? Do you know anything of this?"</p>

<p>"Something; please don't look at me so indignantly,
Cecil. We all love Molly, and it was
quite the last sort of thing we expected her to
do."</p>

<p>"But she did nothing. What do you mean?
Molly loves Kate with all her heart; there is
nothing she would not do for her. What is this
mystery?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps the mystery is being put straight
now," said Hester. "Molly did the very best
thing she could, when she said she would go to
Kate. Kate is excited and softened now, and if
Molly goes to her and confesses, and says she is
sorry, I have not the least doubt that Kate will
forgive her."</p>

<p>"But," said Cecil indignantly, "Molly has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
nothing to be sorry about. If ever a girl in the
world was as true as steel, it is Molly Lavender.
Come," she added, "I am a stranger at present
at St. Dorothy's, I don't know any of you girls,
but I do know Molly Lavender. She and I were
at school together when we were children, and
have been great friends all our lives."</p>

<p>"Then of course you take her part," said
Hester.</p>

<p>Cecil's eyes flashed fire.</p>

<p>"I do," she answered with spirit, "and I
insist on knowing the truth. What has Molly
done?"</p>

<p>"Well, it is this. Kate, for all her high spirits
and her fun and nonsense, has a lot of reserve
about her. She will hardly tell her innermost
thoughts to anyone. Not a soul in the place, except,
of course, Miss Forester and Miss Leicester,
knew about the story which she told us to-night.
We thought of her just like any other girl. We
did not know that she had a romance at the back
of her; we did not know anything about her origin.
Of course she is, in every sense of the word,
a perfect lady, and we just thought, if we thought
at all, that she had been brought up like the rest
of us in a comfortable home, and with all the
usual refinements of life. Well, when Molly
came, Kate took a great fancy to her, and Molly
seemed equally fond of Kate. You know Molly
Lavender is rich, and she has a bedroom to herself,
and all kinds of little luxuries which the
girls who live in dormitories can't aspire to.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
Well, when poor Kate began to sigh, and tried
to get up a society in the cause of the Dwellers
in Cubicles, as she called them, Molly was one of
her most stanch supporters; she shared her
room with her night after night until you came,
Cecil. In short, they were inseparable, and
scarcely ever apart; and one day Kate opened
her heart to Molly, and showed her that picture
which she sketched so graphically for us all to-night.
She never told another soul, and of course
she thought that she was safe with Molly. What
do you think happened? In less than a week
the story began to be known all over the school.
Not dear Kate's own beautiful story, but a
vulgar, common edition of it. Kate was no lady,
Kate used to do menial work, Kate was received
here on charity! You know how silly schoolgirls
can be over this sort of thing; and although
everybody liked Kate, there were some silly girls
who began to look down on her. At last it reached
my ears, and I thought it only fair to tell her."</p>

<p>"Who did you trace the report to?" asked
Cecil.</p>

<p>"Well, of course, Matilda Matthews was in it.
You know what a horrid, disagreeable girl
Matilda is. There is no girl in the whole school
so disliked, and how Molly could have so completely
forgotten herself as to give Matilda her
confidence passes my comprehension. There is
not the least doubt that she did tell her, for the
simple reason that Molly alone, in the whole
school, knew the truth."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>When Hester had finished speaking, there was
a little pause. Cecil was standing up, her face
was white, her eyes stared straight in front of
her; she was evidently thinking hard. Hester
looked at her, and so did several of the other
girls, expecting her to make some response, but
she did not speak.</p>

<p>"Kate was cut to the heart," continued
Hester. "I could see that; not that she said a
great deal to me. She evidently made this little
plan to let the whole school know the real truth.
For my part, I think it very brave of her to stop
gossip in this way; but I am very sorry indeed
about Molly Lavender."</p>

<p>"Thank you for telling me," said Cecil.</p>

<p>"Have you nothing to say?"</p>

<p>"Nothing at present."</p>

<p>"Do you mean to do anything?"</p>

<p>"Yes, everything; but I have nothing to say
on the subject at present."</p>

<p>Cecil left the room. On her way up to her
own room she met Molly. Molly's eyes were
red, her face pale.</p>

<p>"Have you seen her, Molly?" asked Cecil.</p>

<p>"No; she locked herself into her cubicle, and
would not see me. I called to her through the
door, but she would not reply. Cecil, what does
it all mean?"</p>

<p>"It means treachery," said Cecil. "I have
got to the bottom of it now. This thing must be
put right, somehow. I made Hester tell me the
whole story."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>"Kate seems to suspect me," said Molly, putting
up her hand to her head. "I never felt so
puzzled in my life."</p>

<p>"Well, come into your room, and let us talk
it out," said Cecil.</p>

<p>The girls entered Molly's room. She turned
on the electric light, and they sat down side by
side on her little bed.</p>

<p>"It is a great matter to know the truth," said
Cecil. "The facts of the case are simply these:
Kate confided her story to you."</p>

<p>"Yes; about three weeks ago."</p>

<p>"Well, since then it has got into the school,
and Kate suspects that you betrayed her confidence
to Matilda Matthews."</p>

<p>"How dared she?" said Molly, coloring crimson.
"What kind of girl must she think me?"</p>

<p>"Well, Molly, we must get to the bottom of
it somehow. There is not the least manner of
doubt that you are the only person in the school
who had been told Kate's secret until to-night.
Of course you never told: you would not breathe
a word&mdash;that goes without saying. We need not
waste our breath over that. The thing to find
out is, how Matilda got her knowledge."</p>

<p>"I have not the faintest idea," said Molly.
"I remember the day when Kate told me. We
had taken a long walk together. She is a great
botanist, and she was explaining to me some
wonderfully interesting things about some plants
which we had come across in our walk; then we
went into the playground, and we sat in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
summerhouse. It was a warm day for the time
of year, and we were both tired and hot from our
walk. There was not a soul anywhere near&mdash;not
a single soul. Some girls in the distance were
playing hockey; we did not take any notice of
them. I asked Kate quite suddenly how she
knew so much about plants. She looked at
me&mdash;she gave me one of those straight glances
which always somehow went to my heart, and
then, she began to speak about her grandfather.
The moment she mentioned him, she began to get
enthusiastic. She drew such a picture that I
became almost beside myself with delight and
appreciation, that fact drew her on to tell me
more. She described the cows and the little
cottage, and the view from her bedroom window.
Perhaps she did not make such a graphic picture
of the whole thing as she did to-night, but the
story was the same. I never loved her more, nor
respected her more. Of course it was told in the
greatest confidence, and it never passed my
lips&mdash;never, until now when I am telling you."</p>

<p>"It is no secret now," said Cecil; "all the
world knows, or, at least, all our school world
knows, that you have been confided in, and that
you are supposed to be the betrayer. How in
the world did the story get out?"</p>

<p>"That I can't tell," said Molly. "It is a
mystery which I can't explain."</p>

<p>"Are you quite certain there was no one
near?"</p>

<p>"Quite, quite, quite! Don't you know the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
house in the playground, Cecil? It is nothing
but a bare room&mdash;just a few chairs and a couple
of benches, and lots of hooks on the walls to
hang up our cricket and tennis bats. We had
the summerhouse to ourselves, and there was
not a soul in sight."</p>

<p>"I must try and get to the bottom of this,"
said Cecil.</p>

<p>"What do you mean to do? I feel quite in
despair. I shall, of course, tell Kate the moment
I see her that I am quite innocent, that she is
unjust in suspecting me; but I greatly fear,
from her manner to-night, and from her refusing
to see me, that she will not believe my word."</p>

<p>"Dear Molly, she shall believe you yet," said
Cecil, in a caressing voice.</p>

<p>Molly leaned up against her friend.</p>

<p>"It is such a comfort to have you in school,
Ceci," she said. "Oh, it is very wrong of me to
think so much of myself in this matter."</p>

<p>"How can you help it, you poor dear? You,
of all people, to be suspected of this sort of
thing; but, never mind, I am going to take it
up now."</p>

<p>"I can't imagine what you will do."</p>

<p>"I don't quite know myself yet, but I am not
sister to four brothers for nothing. If you only
could guess, Molly, what scrapes those boys
have been in&mdash;the kind of things even Maurice
has been suspected of doing. But I have always
got them to confide in me; and somehow, when
we talked the thing out, and straightened it a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
bit, and got the tangles out of it, as it were, we
always began to get glimpses of daylight. Of
course I could not interfere in the boys' affairs
as I can in yours, but I have before now set quite
hopeless sort of scrapes&mdash;indeed they seemed so
at the time&mdash;straight."</p>

<p>"Well, I wish you would take me up," said
Molly.</p>

<p>"I intend to, you may be sure, and also that
poor Kate O'Connor. Of course I am angry with
her for suspecting you, but it is impossible not
to love her and be interested in her. Now,
Molly, I want you to promise me one thing."</p>

<p>"What is that?"</p>

<p>"Just tell Kate the truth quite simply to-morrow;
don't exaggerate, and don't protest. Tell
her you know she suspects you, assure her of
your innocence, and then leave the matter in my
hands; don't say another word. Of course it is
easy to guess who is at the bottom of all the
mischief."</p>

<p>"Who?" inquired Molly.</p>

<p>"Why, Matilda Matthews! Did you notice
how anxious Kate was to keep her in the room
this evening, and how often Matilda made for
the door? I was quite amused watching the
clever way in which Kate kept her victim within
sight. Of course I could not guess her motive at
the time; now I see that she wanted to shame
Matilda thoroughly."</p>

<p>"Yes; I hate Matilda!" said Molly. "I
never did hate anyone before, but I hate her!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
Of course she has made the mischief; but how
did she find out? That is the puzzle of all
puzzles, Cecil."</p>

<p>"Of course it is a puzzle," said Cecil; "but
we'll drag it into the light of day somehow.
Now, Molly, I'm dead tired, and I think I must
say good-night."</p>

<p>"Good-night!" said Molly.</p>

<p>A moment later her friend went away.</p>

<p>Cecil ran upstairs to her own cubicle. It was
next to Kate's, and as she laid her head on her
pillow she thought she heard a sound something
like a sob not far away. She longed to speak
and give a word of comfort, but she knew that
anything she said would be overheard by other
girls. There was nothing for her to do but to
bide her time.</p>

<p>Cecil's new life was full of the keenest
interests. Her examinations had been successful.
She had taken a high place in the school.
Miss Forester had already singled her out for
special notice. It was arranged that she was to
try for the great yearly scholarship given by the
governors of Redgarth to the best pupil, and
her head was absorbed with the new and vivid
interests which her different studies were bringing
to her. Nevertheless, Cecil had lived an
unselfish life; she loved Molly with all her
heart and soul, and determined not to leave a
stone unturned to get her out of her present
difficulty. She lay awake for a short time
thinking about her, suppressed a sigh as she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
thought of the valuable help Maurice, not to say
Jimmy, could give her in this emergency; for
Maurice was the soul of common sense, and
Jimmy was a born detective. But as the boys
were far away, she had to trust to her own
ingenuity. Suddenly an idea darted through
her mind. Why not write to Jimmy and ask
his advice?</p>

<p>"I never knew such a lad for ferreting out
mysteries," thought Cecil. "I need not give
him any names, but I'll just put the case in
a few strong words, and see what he suggests.
The thing to find out is this: How did Matilda
get her knowledge? I'll put the whole case
to Jimmy."</p>

<p>Cecil knew that she would have no time to do
this in the morning. She got softly out of bed,
lit her candle, sat down before her writing-desk,
and wrote the following letter:</p>

<blockquote>

<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Dear Jimmy</span>:</div>

<p>You know you are fond of mysteries. Can you make
anything out of the following? You must forgive me for
not mentioning names. The case is just as I am putting it.
There is a very nice girl in this school; she is what you
would call a brick; she has a friend who is just as nice in
her own way. The friend is the sort of true girl who
would not tell a secret for all the world. One day these
two girls were sitting together in a little summerhouse,
made of wood, in our large playground. The one girl told
the other girl a secret. It was an important secret, and
just the sort which any person who had a grain of honor
in him or her would rather be cut in pieces than tell again.
Well, Jimmy, in some mysterious way the secret has got<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
out; everyone in the school knows about it, and the poor
dear girl, who would rather have her tongue cut out than
betray her friend, is supposed to have been treacherous,
and to have betrayed her friend's confidence. In some
dreadful way the secret has got into the hands of a very
unscrupulous girl in the school, and she is making use of
it, and we're all unhappy. There was not a soul anywhere
near the summerhouse when the one girl told the
other the secret. How did the mischievous, cruel girl get
hold of it? That is what I want to know. Now, Jimmy,
dear, set your keen detective wits to work and give me
a clew, if you can. Give my love to Maurice; I will write
to him on Saturday. I hope you all try not to make poor
Mr. Danvers too unhappy.</p>

<div class='sig'>
<span style="margin-right: 2em;">Your loving sister,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Cecil</span>.<br />
</div>

<p>P.S.&mdash;Write by return, if you can. Set your keen wits
to work, Jimmy, and give me a solution of this mystery as
you love me.</p></blockquote>

<p>Cecil felt absurdly cheered when she had
written this letter. She went back to bed, and
soon afterward fell asleep.</p>

<p>The next morning Kate came down to breakfast
looking just as usual. She was watched
with great interest when she entered the breakfast
room, but except that she held her head
a little higher than usual, and that her cheeks
were even brighter than of yore, there seemed
no change whatever about her. She talked a
good deal during breakfast, and even addressed
Molly Lavender as if nothing special had happened.
Cecil watched her with anxiety; Molly
avoided meeting her eyes. Immediately after
breakfast followed prayers, and then the girls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
went up to their rooms to get ready to go to
school. Molly ran up to hers, put on her hat
and jacket, snatched up her exercise and note
books, and went and waited in the hall. Kate,
as a rule, was one of the first to go to school.
Molly felt her heart beating faster than usual as
she heard her light footsteps coming downstairs.</p>

<p>"Kate, I want to speak to you," said Molly,
the moment Kate entered the wide central hall.</p>

<p>"Well, what is it, Molly?" answered Kate.</p>

<p>She had been looking quite bright and cheerful
when she came into the hall; some words of
a little song which she used to sing to Cusha
were bubbling from her lips. Kate had a voice
sweet and true as a lark's. The gay sound
stopped when Molly addressed her. Molly's
brown eyes met hers fully.</p>

<p>"I must say it," said Molly; "you shan't
hinder me. I know you suspect me, Kate."</p>

<p>"We won't say anything more on the subject
now, Molly," replied Kate, in a gentle tone.</p>

<p>"We must," replied Molly, with spirit. "Do
you think I am going to live under suspicion?
Look at me, Kate, and tell me if I seem like the
sort of girl you suspect me of being."</p>

<p>"No, you don't; that is the cruel thing," said
Kate, giving her a critical glance.</p>

<p>"Kate, won't you believe me?" said Molly.
Her voice grew full of entreaty. "I never betrayed
anyone in all my life; I never told a lie
in all my life; I never broke a confidence since I
was born. I have plenty of faults, but these are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
not mine. Is it likely, Kate, that I would tell
what you told me in such confidence? Is it
likely&mdash;is it?"</p>

<p>"No," said Kate, "it is not likely, but&mdash;&mdash;"
She paused.</p>

<p>"Yes, Kate, yes! what do you mean by 'but'?
Do you still believe that I betrayed you?"</p>

<p>"How can I help myself, Molly?"</p>

<p>Molly's eyes grew full of tears. The voices of
several girls were heard approaching.</p>

<p>"Listen," said Kate, going quickly to Molly's
side. "I spoke to Miss Leicester this morning.
She said that, after all, mine was a sort of false
humility last night. She was sorry that I told
my story to the school. I am not sorry; I am
glad that everyone knows. I hate deception,
and there is no deception now. I would give all
the world not to believe that you broke my confidence,
Molly; but I told no one else."</p>

<p>"I never broke it," said Molly. "I had not
the faintest idea why you were cold and distant
to me until last night. Now, I wish to tell you
emphatically that I am innocent&mdash;innocent as a
baby."</p>

<p>Kate looked full at her; the girls were entering
the hall. Molly laid her hand on Kate's
arm.</p>

<p>"You do believe me&mdash;you must!" said Molly.</p>

<p>"No!" replied Kate.</p>

<p>Molly rushed away.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.<br />

<small>THE LITTLE HOLE IN THE SUMMERHOUSE.</small></h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-o.jpg" width="59" height="58" alt="O" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi3">ON a post card came Jimmy's reply. It
was decidedly enigmatical and short.</div>

<p>"Look out for eavesdroppers. Your
affectionate brother."</p>

<p>The post card was lying on Cecil's plate when
she came in to dinner on a certain Saturday
afternoon. She hastily slipped it into her
pocket. On Saturday afternoon there was, of
course, a half holiday. Only those who were
working very hard for a coming examination
dreamt of turning to books on such a lovely day
as this.</p>

<p>Kate, who seemed to have completely recovered
her spirits, and who was more popular than ever
at St. Dorothy's, was off on a long botanical
expedition with several other girls. Molly had
a headache, and preferred a quiet time in her
own room. Cecil meanwhile felt Jimmy's card
burning a hole in her pocket.</p>

<p>"Look out for eavesdroppers," she repeated
to herself.</p>

<p>Until she received her brother's frank communication,
it had never occurred to her to solve
the mystery in this way.</p>

<p>"Eavesdropping is such a schoolboy trick!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
she said to herself. "I doubt whether there is
anything in Jimmy's solution, but such as it is,
I am bound to act on it. I shall visit the summerhouse
this afternoon."</p>

<p>Cecil went to her cubicle as this thought came
to her, and hastily put on her hat, jacket, and
gloves.</p>

<p>"Are you coming with us, Cecil?" called out
Kate, who was just preparing for her own walk
in the cubicle near by.</p>

<p>"Not to-day," replied Cecil.</p>

<p>"I wish you would; you have more taste for
botany than all the other girls at St. Dorothy's
put together. I know some rocks where we can
get lovely specimens of rare ferns. Do come!"</p>

<p>"No; I can't," replied Cecil.</p>

<p>Her door was a little open; Kate came to it
now, and pushed in her laughing face.</p>

<p>"It strikes me," she said, lowering her voice
to a whisper as she spoke, "that you do not
greatly care to be friends with me."</p>

<p>"Yes, I do, Kate," replied Cecil, "but you
are unjust to Molly; you are making Molly
suffer very much. There is no one near now, so
I am able to speak what is in my mind. Molly
is in trouble because you do not believe her.
You accuse her in your own mind of a most base
and dishonorable act."</p>

<p>"Oh, how you worry me!" said Kate. "Do
you think that I would believe anything against
Molly if I could help myself? Do you think I
<i>want</i> to doubt?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>"You shall not long," said Cecil, with spirit.
"I have made up my mind not to leave a stone
unturned to set this matter straight. Go for
your walk, Kate, enjoy your botany, but try and
remember that, because you have so little faith,
you are making a most loving and loyal heart
suffer. Go! I think you are a noble girl in
many ways, but I am surprised at your want of
faith."</p>

<p>Kate looked as astonished as if someone had
suddenly slapped her in the face. She stood
silent for a moment, opened her lips once as if
she meant to say something, changed her mind,
and went softly away. A moment or two later
Cecil left the house.</p>

<p>"I feel as if I were engaged on a very dirty,
disagreeable bit of work," she said to herself.
"I <i>must</i> find out if it would have been possible
for anyone to have overheard Kate's and Molly's
conversation. Let me see, an idea comes to me.
Why should not Matilda Matthews herself help
me to unravel this mystery? Matilda is always
dying to be seen with the St. Dorothy girls. I
must pander to her weakness a little now. After
all, it is in a good cause."</p>

<p>Matilda lived at Dacre House. It was one of
the most fashionable of the houses of residence;
only really rich girls could afford to go there.
Matilda's father and mother had more money
than they knew what to do with. Matilda was
their only child, and they did not care what
expense they lavished on her. Cecil had never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
yet been to Dacre House. It was at the other
side of the great school quadrangle. She soon
found herself walking up the wide flight of steps,
and ringing the hall door bell. A neatly dressed
servant quickly answered her summons.</p>

<p>"I have called to see Miss Matthews. Do
you happen to know if she is in?" inquired
Cecil.</p>

<p>"I don't know, miss; I'll inquire. Will you
come upstairs to the drawing room, please?"</p>

<p>Cecil obeyed.</p>

<p>Dacre House was richly and expensively furnished;
there were Turkey carpets on the stairs;
the drawing room was a very large and luxurious
apartment. Cecil looked round her with a sense
of dissatisfaction. She missed the plain, but
exquisite, neatness of St. Dorothy's.</p>

<p>"I am glad I am there," she said to herself.</p>

<p>At this moment Matilda entered the room.
She quite blushed and giggled when she saw
Cecil.</p>

<p>"How do you do?" she said, in a sentimental
voice. "Is not the day lovely?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Cecil. "I want to know if you
will come for a walk with me, Matilda?"</p>

<p>"With you?" asked Matilda, her dull eyes
lighting up. "Do you want us to be chums?"</p>

<p>Cecil hated herself&mdash;she found that to gain her
object she must really act with guile. Never
before had straightforward Cecil stooped to this
sort of work.</p>

<p>"Never mind, it is in the cause of friendship,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
she said to her aggrieved conscience. Aloud she
replied:</p>

<p>"I have not thought whether we are to be
chums or not. I simply want a companion to
spend the afternoon with me."</p>

<p>"Don't you like the girls at St. Dorothy's?"
asked Matilda, in a low voice.</p>

<p>"Of course I do! they are delightful. We can
discuss them when we are out&mdash;that is, if you are
coming."</p>

<p>Matilda had every intention of coming. It was
all very well to be rich, and to be surrounded by
luxuries, and to be fawned on by girls poorer
than herself, but she knew in her heart of hearts
that she lacked those things which girls like Cecil
Ross and Molly Lavender, and even poor, low-born
Kate O'Connor, possessed. She lacked
sadly all that nobility of spirit which shone in
Cecil's eyes, and was reflected in every tone of
Molly's sweet voice. She hated the girls who
possessed those gifts which had been denied to
her. She underwent unceasing mortification
from the fact that her own figure was squat, her
own face plain and freckled, from the knowledge
that no amount of fine dress could make her look
the least like a lady.</p>

<p>"Yes, I'll go," she said, after a pause. "I
did not mean to go out this afternoon, for I have
just had a new novel sent to me by post, and I
meant to sit by the fire and enjoy it, but as you
have been good enough to call, Cecil, I won't refuse
your request. I dare say you find it rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
lonely at present, but you will soon have plenty
of friends. Perhaps you know that I am going
to St. Dorothy's at the half term. When I go
there, I'll promise to do my best for you."</p>

<p>"Well, run and put on your hat now," said
Cecil, "and let us start."</p>

<p>"Where shall we go?" asked Matilda, when
the girls had left Dacre House.</p>

<p>"Shall we go to the big playground first? I
have not half seen it."</p>

<p>"We'll go there, if you like; but I don't care
for hockey, lacrosse, nor any of those mannish
games. My father is old-fashioned; he likes me
to be thoroughly educated, but he always says,
'Be feminine before all things, Matilda.' I think
hockey, and cricket, and cycling so very unfeminine,
don't you?"</p>

<p>"Not at all," replied Cecil. "Of course, taken
in excess, they may be bad; but, really," she
added, "I have not studied the subject."</p>

<p>"Nor have I&mdash;not seriously. I hate discussing
all those women's questions; we're always having
them in our debating society. After all, what
is the use? I, for one, mean to marry well. My
idea is to marry a man twice my own age, because
he will make a pet of me. I'd rather be an old
man's darling, than a young man's slave;
wouldn't you, Cecil?"</p>

<p>"I don't intend to be either," replied Cecil.</p>

<p>"Do you mind my leaning on you?" asked
Matilda. "I'm quite certain we'll be chums. I
like your face; you don't know how I admire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
independent sort of girls like you. How fast you
walk! It quite blows me to walk as fast as that.
Ah, that's better, let me catch on to your arm;
you don't mind, do you?"</p>

<p>If Cecil had spoken the truth, she would have
said, "I mind intensely." As it was, she made
no response. Matilda took silence for consent.
One or two of the St. Dorothy girls passed them,
and stared when they saw who Cecil Ross' companion
was.</p>

<p>"What conceited creatures those schoolgirls
are!" said Matilda. "And of all the girls in the
place none give themselves such airs as those
who live at St. Dorothy's. Well, here we are at
the playground. What do you mean to do, now
we have got here, Cecil? For my part, I am not
a good walker; I require plenty of rest; I have
none of the muscle which characterises the
modern girl."</p>

<p>"I should think not," thought Cecil to herself.
Aloud she said:</p>

<p>"If you are tired, we can sit in the summerhouse."</p>

<p>"A good idea," responded Matilda; "we can
watch the girls at their cricket and lacrosse from
there. Let us go straight to the summerhouse,
and look on at the different games. I don't
object to looking on, but I hate joining. When
first I went to Dacre House, I was forced to join,
but now, thank goodness! I am past that stage.
Of course, when I go to St. Dorothy's, I shall be
more or less my own mistress."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>"What a big world this great school is!" said
Cecil.</p>

<p>"Yes, isn't it?" replied Matilda. "But though
it's big, it's narrow, too. Do you see that set of
girls over there? They are most of them in dark
blue, with white sailor hats; they live in Miss
Ford's house. Miss Ford and Mrs. Churchill put
on the most fearful airs, and so do their girls.
The girls in those two houses are the aristocrats
of the school; one or two of them have titles, and
several are honorables. Father made a great
effort to get me into Mrs. Churchill's house.
Father is first cousin to Sir John Jones, and Sir
John Jones was made a baronet ten years ago;
but Mrs. Churchill is so exclusive, and when she
heard that father had made his money by tallow,
it was decided that I had better go to Dacre
House. Don't you think all that sort of thing
very ridiculous?"</p>

<p>"I am incapable of judging," replied Cecil.
"I suppose as long as the world lasts there will
be distinctions of class."</p>

<p>"Oh, good gracious! how frightfully conservative
and old-fashioned you are!"</p>

<p>"Not at all; you mistake me. I am indifferent
myself to all that sort of thing. I have come
to school to study; I want to get the governors'
scholarship, if I can."</p>

<p>"You belong to the distinction of talent. I
have no doubt you are clever; you look it. For
my part, I hate study, and, if it were not for
mother, would not dream of going to Cambridge.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
But mother's heart is set on it; Sir John Jones'
daughter is at Girton now, and she hopes I may
make her acquaintance. I know that is the real
reason she is sending me, but I hope you won't
repeat it."</p>

<p>Cecil shut her lips; she was quite silent.</p>

<p>They soon reached the summerhouse, and
seated themselves in such a position that they
had a good view of the field. Several games
were going on vigorously, and Cecil's thoughts
reverted to her brothers. She wondered if they,
too, were having a good time on that bright
Saturday afternoon.</p>

<p>"By the way," said Matilda, in a low, wheedling
sort of tone; "talking of rank and all that,
don't you think it is odd of Miss Forester to
allow a girl like Kate O'Connor to come to Redgarth?"</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Cecil calmly.</p>

<p>"Why? Need you ask? Her origin!"</p>

<p>"What about her origin?" asked Cecil.</p>

<p>"Well," Matilda giggled, "I think she has
explained all that herself."</p>

<p>"She has told us of a very beautiful life which
she led in Ireland," said Cecil. "I fail to see
where her low origin comes in. Hers was the
sort of life which Tennyson, if he were now alive,
would write a lovely ballad about."</p>

<p>"Oh, if you take it in that spirit, I have not a
word to say," replied Matilda. "I knew there
were some silly, romantic, sentimental girls at
St. Dorothy's, but I did not know that you were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
one. I am glad it has not been my lot in life to
milk cows, and clean dairies, and weed stupid
little gardens."</p>

<p>"And read Shakspere, and the Bible, and the
book of nature," continued Cecil, in fine scorn.
"Such privileges are only accorded to the few."</p>

<p>"I suppose Kate is one of nature's ladies,"
said Matilda, in a reflective tone. "I suppose
you are all going to take her up more heartily
than ever, after her extraordinary exhibition
the other night?"</p>

<p>"After the very beautiful poem which she
recited in our presence," cried Cecil. "Yes;
we will all take her up warmly."</p>

<p>"I could see that there was a good deal of
hurt feeling behind all that fine oration,"
responded Matilda, after a pause; "I expect
she was very angry with her dear friend Molly
Lavender for betraying her."</p>

<p>"Molly never betrayed her," replied Cecil,
with firmness.</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear Cecil! how can you believe
that story? Why, Molly even hinted two or
three things to me."</p>

<p>"Did she? I was going to ask you about
those two or three things," said Cecil.</p>

<p>Matilda fidgeted uneasily.</p>

<p>"I don't mean that she said <i>much</i>," she
interrupted.</p>

<p>"Precisely; perhaps you will tell me what
she did say."</p>

<p>"How can I recollect now?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>"You must recollect," said Cecil suddenly.
"The fact is this: Molly declares that she never
repeated a single word of Kate's confidence to
you. You must tell what she really said,
Matilda, and perhaps the best way&mdash;the very
best way&mdash;is to tell me in Molly's own presence."</p>

<p>"You frighten me," said Matilda. "You
know how I hate getting into rows. There is
not a girl in the whole school who hates that
sort of thing more than I do; I believe you
brought me out here on purpose."</p>

<p>"I thought perhaps you would help me,"
said Cecil. "The fact is, I am very unhappy
about this. Molly is supposed by Kate to have
betrayed her secret. Kate and Molly were great
friends; now their friendship has been completely
broken. Molly's word is beyond suspicion.
Do you know, Matilda,"&mdash;Cecil stood
up as she spoke,&mdash;"do you know that it was in
this summerhouse, just here, that Kate told
Molly that beautiful story of her early home
which she repeated again for our benefit a few
nights ago?"</p>

<p>"Was it?" replied Matilda. Her mottled
face grew red; her small eyes did not dare to
meet Cecil's. "I am sure," she added sulkily,
"I don't care where it was told; I knew nothing
about it. Molly herself told me the very
little I know; other girls seemed to have heard
of it at the same time."</p>

<p>"Molly never told you," said Cecil; "that
is a lie!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>"How dare you, Cecil Ross, accuse me of
anything so unladylike? I shall not stay another
moment in your presence."</p>

<p>"Yes, you shall," replied Cecil. "I don't
mean to conceal my motives any longer from
you. I suspect you of having got your information,
not from Molly, who would rather cut out
her tongue than betray her friend, but in some
underhand way. Yes, I am very angry and
very determined, and I am not the sister of four
brothers, and I have not got to fight my own way
in the world, for nothing. I know I am a new
girl at St. Dorothy's, and a new member of
this great school, but that will not deter me
from trying to clear up this mischief as soon as
possible."</p>

<p>"Oh, what a shabby, mean wretch you are!"
cried Matilda. "I shall leave you at once."</p>

<p>"You need not stay long, but you shall until
I do what I have come to do. This door is
open, but I see that it can be shut, and that
there is a key to it. I mean to lock the door
while I explore this summerhouse."</p>

<p>Cecil walked quickly to the entrance as she
spoke. She was a head and shoulders over
Matilda, and had twice her physical strength.
Matilda rushed to the door to escape, but Cecil
was too quick for her. In a moment the door
was locked; the key was in Cecil's pocket.
She turned round and faced her angry companion.
Matilda was now as frightened as she
was angry. She had never met determination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
like Cecil's before. She sat down on the nearest
chair and began to cry.</p>

<p>"Oh, how awfully shabby and unkind you
are!" she cried. "What can you mean to do
with me?"</p>

<p>"Nothing; you shall help me to search the
summerhouse."</p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>"Just to see if, by any possibility, Kate's and
Molly's conversation could have been overheard."</p>

<p>"I won't do it, Cecil Ross; I won't!"</p>

<p>"All right; you can sit in that corner, and I'll
search by myself."</p>

<p>Cecil felt herself at that moment endowed with
all Jimmy's detective qualities; she moved the
simple furniture, and poked about for a time
without success, but suddenly observing a row
of bats on the wooden wall, just on a level with
the bench on which she and Matilda had been
seated, she removed them one by one. Behind
one of the bats was a notch of wood, out of which
a hard wood kernel had been carefully removed.
A round hole was therefore distinctly visible,
against which a person from outside might put
either an ear or an eye.</p>

<p>"This hole looks rather suspicious," said
Cecil. "Matilda, will you kindly come forward,
and let me see if you are the right height to use
such a peep-hole with advantage?"</p>

<p>"I won't! I daren't!" said Matilda. "I hate
you, Cecil."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well," said Cecil, "you have only one thing
to do. I know by your face that you are guilty.
I was not, of course, at all certain when we
started out on our walk this afternoon, but now
I know. If you refuse to confess, I will go to
Miss Forester and tell her what I suspect."</p>

<p>"A nice life you will have at Redgarth, if you
begin by telling tales!" said Matilda, in faltering
tones.</p>

<p>"I don't care a bit about that. I'm not going
to have that old bugbear cast up against me; it
will not prevent me on this occasion from doing
my duty. You have just confessed that Molly
told you certain matters which gave you the clew
to Kate's past. Had you not better tell me
everything at once?"</p>

<p>"Oh, what a fearful, fearful girl you are!"
sobbed Matilda. "Oh, I won't stay another day
at Redgarth!"</p>

<p>"If you confess the simple truth," repeated
Cecil, "I will do my utmost to shield you. I
mean I will do all in my power to prevent the
school generally, and the teachers, knowing of
your baseness. Of course, Kate and Molly must
know directly. Now, you can choose."</p>

<p>Matilda sat huddled up against the wall. It
would have been difficult to see a more abject
figure than hers.</p>

<p>"Molly told me," she began at last. "I asked
her if Kate&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wait a moment," said Cecil suddenly. "I
have changed my mind about hearing you alone.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
Molly is at home; she is in her room. You
shall come to her at once; you shall tell me in
her presence <i>exactly</i> what occurred."</p>

<p>"I won't! you can't force me!" cried Matilda.</p>

<p>At this moment the handle of the summerhouse
door was forcibly turned from without.</p>

<p>"Who has locked the door?" cried Miss
Leicester's voice.</p>

<p>"That is right," said Cecil, with a sigh of
relief. "Miss Leicester will soon put things
straight. Wait one moment, Miss Leicester, and
I will let you in."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't, I beg of you, betray me to Miss
Leicester!" cried Matilda.</p>

<p>"Will you come to Molly at once, then?"</p>

<p>"I will; anything rather than that Miss
Leicester should know."</p>

<p>"All right; if you even attempt to escape,
I will repeat to Miss Leicester all that I have
said to you."</p>

<p>As Cecil said these last words, she turned the
key in the door, opened it wide, and stood before
her astonished principal.</p>

<p>"My dear," said that good lady, "why did
you lock the door?"</p>

<p>"I was having a very important talk with
Matilda," said Cecil.</p>

<p>"But to lock the door! It is not the custom,
Cecil."</p>

<p>"I am sorry; I won't do it again," said Cecil.</p>

<p>"Can you not give me your reason?"</p>

<p>"I am dreadfully sorry, I cannot."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>Miss Leicester looked from one girl to the
other: there was a look in Cecil's eyes, an expression
about Matilda's mouth, which made her feel
that the solution of a very unpleasant mystery
was about to be made.</p>

<p>"Don't lock the summerhouse again, dear,"
she said, in a kindly voice to her pupil. She
then walked past the two girls to fetch her
tennis bat, which was hanging on the wall.</p>

<p>"Come, Matilda," said Cecil. She held out her
hand as she spoke; Matilda took it grudgingly.</p>

<p>On the way to the playground, she had been
glad enough to show all the world that she was
one of Cecil Ross' friends; on her return, she
would have been only too thankful to be miles
away from this very determined young person.
But in vain did she look from right to left for a
loophole to escape. After a few minutes' quick
walking, the two girls found themselves at St.
Dorothy's; a moment later they stood outside
Molly Lavender's door. Cecil knocked softly.</p>

<p>"Come in," called Molly's voice.</p>

<p>Her headache had grown so bad that she had
been forced to lie down, but she started upright
when she saw who was following Cecil into the
room.</p>

<p>"I am sorry to disturb you," said Cecil;
"but I think it is worth while, for the matter
I have come about is somewhat important.
Matilda wants to say something to you, Molly."</p>

<p>"What?" asked Molly. "Won't you sit
down, Matilda? How do you do?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>Matilda flopped down on the nearest chair.
She took off her hat, and wiped the moisture
from her hot forehead.</p>

<p>"This is a very disagreeable business," she
said, "and I can't imagine what Cecil Ross is
about."</p>

<p>"Yes, you know perfectly well," said Cecil.
"The fact is this, Molly: I had a walk with
Matilda this afternoon. We sat in the summerhouse;
we spoke of you and Kate O'Connor.
While we were there I told Matilda that some
of the mischievous reports with regard to poor
Kate had been traced to her. In reply, she said
that she had only circulated what you yourself
had told her."</p>

<p>"What <i>I</i> told her?" repeated Molly, her eyes
and cheeks alike flaming.</p>

<p>"Yes; and I thought the matter so important
that I insisted on her coming here to tell her
story to you direct."</p>

<p>"But I never told you anything, Matilda,"
said Molly.</p>

<p>"Yes, you did," said Matilda, driven to bay;
"but I won't repeat it. I won't say anything
unless&mdash;unless you, Cecil, promise."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll promise! and so will Molly," said
Cecil, in a somewhat careless and very scornful
tone.</p>

<p>"What are we to promise?" said Molly.</p>

<p>"Matilda does not want to get into trouble
with the authorities," said Cecil. "We can
shield her from that, I suppose&mdash;that is, if she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
tells us the whole truth without any reservation."</p>

<p>Molly put her hand to her brow.</p>

<p>"I am quite bewildered," she said. "I never
told you anything, Matilda. Oh, I must leave
the matter in your hands, Cecil! Promise her
anything, only get her to tell me the truth
now."</p>

<p>"Well," said Matilda, "don't you remember
one day at lecture when I spoke to you? You
hated my doing so, I know."</p>

<p>"Of course I did," said Molly.</p>

<p>"Well, I spoke to you about Kate."</p>

<p>"I begin to remember," said Molly. "I was
glad, for you spoke kindly of her."</p>

<p>"I asked you," continued Matilda, "if you
did not consider Kate out of the common. I
said that very likely she was one of those brave
girls who had known poverty and had risen
above it. I asked you if you did not think her
one of nature's ladies. You replied that every
word I said was the perfect truth. I went on to
ask you: 'Has she not known poverty and
risen above it?' You replied: 'Yes, she has
had a noble life.'"</p>

<p>"And is that all?" said Molly, springing
from her sofa and beginning to pace the room.
"Oh, how mean, how mean you are! You drew
me out on purpose. I only spoke in a general
way. Oh, Matilda, how could you be so frightfully
underhand?"</p>

<p>"That was not the way you got your information,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
said Cecil, in her calm, clear voice.
"What about the little hole at the back of the
summerhouse, which I proved by measurement
to be exactly on a level with your ear?"</p>

<p>Matilda colored crimson.</p>

<p>"You must tell everything," continued Cecil,
"or I shall take this story straight to Miss
Forester."</p>

<p>"If I must, I must; after all, why should I
care what girls like you think about me?
I&mdash;&mdash;" She paused.</p>

<p>"Go on," said Cecil; "we're both listening."</p>

<p>"There is not much in it, after all. What an
awful fuss you do make! I was at the back of the
summerhouse, tying up my shoe. I heard Kate
and Molly talking; the hole in the wood was
quite handy. I did listen for a bit, I heard
something."</p>

<p>"And you questioned Molly on purpose," said
Cecil; "in order to give color to the horrid story
which you meant to tell."</p>

<p>"The fact is, I hated you, Molly Lavender,
from the first," said Matilda. "You snubbed
me and were disagreeable; I thought I'd have my
revenge, that's all. I suppose I may go now?"</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it," said Cecil. "Before you
leave this room, you have got to write down
every word you have just told me. Here is
paper; here are pens and ink; seat yourself;
write away."</p>

<p>"Oh, but I really don't want to put the thing
on paper!"</p>

<p>"All right; then Miss Forester shall hear this
little story."</p>

<p>"Before I write anything," said Matilda, "I
must know to whom my confession is to be
repeated?"</p>

<p>Cecil spoke without hesitation.</p>

<p>"Kate O'Connor must know first of all," she
said; "also Hester Temple. I have given you
my word that what we say shall not reach any of
the authorities, but Molly and Hester and Kate
and I must have a consultation with regard to
whether the other girls in the school are to know
the truth or not. Now, sit down; write, and be
quick about it."</p>

Cecil was a great deal too strong for her in every
sense of the word.</p>

  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-a.jpg" width="59" height="60" alt="A" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi3">AT last the unpleasant task was over,
and Matilda, vowing vengeance against
everyone, returned to Dacre House.
When they were alone, Cecil and
Molly looked at each other.</div>

<p>"How splendid you are, Cecil!" said Molly.
"How can I ever thank you? I can scarcely
tell you what a load you have lifted from my
mind."</p>

<p>"You must thank Jimmy, then," said Cecil.
"I should never have discovered the truth but
for him."</p>

<p>"Your brother Jimmy?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Molly raised her eyebrows.</p>

<p>"Really, you are quite enigmatical," she said.
"How can Jimmy, who is far away, have anything
to do with the matter?"</p>

<p>"He is our detective," said Cecil, who was
feeling so happy that she felt inclined to skip.
"I put the case before him, mentioning no
names. The wicked boy had the audacity to
reply on a post card. The words of the oracle
were as follows: 'Look out for eavesdroppers.'
That little sentence gave me the clew; I took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
Matilda to the summerhouse, began to talk over
the occurrence, told her with all the emphasis I
could that you and Kate had sat together on the
very bench where she and I were then resting,
when Kate made her confidence to you. Matilda,
fortunately for the non-success of her wicked
plans, has a tell-tale face. I soon got her into
the center of a circle, and hedged her in. Oh, it
was a horrid business! How thankful I am that
it is over!"</p>

<p>"I feel my heart as light as a feather once
again," said Molly. "Let us go at once to find
Kate; she is sure to be returning from her
botany expedition by now. Cecil, you don't
know what Kate was before this cloud came
over her; she was the life of the whole house.
Oh, you will love her as much as I do!"</p>

<p>"I'm quite sure I shall," answered Cecil. "I
like her immensely already. When I have forgiven
her for doubting you, I dare say I shall see
that she is just as charming as you have described
her."</p>

<p>"You have cured my headache," said Molly.
"I can't stay indoors any longer; let us go and
meet Kate and the others."</p>

<p>The girls were soon out of doors. The day
was a crisp one in late October. There was a
feeling of coming winter in the air, but all nature
was still peaceful and smiling. The trees
still wore their autumn dress; grand crimson
and yellow robes decked the landscape.</p>

<p>Molly and Cecil walked some little distance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
They soon found themselves in the country.
Suddenly Molly uttered an exclamation. Kate
and her companions were coming slowly to meet
them.</p>

<p>"How tired Kitty looks!" said Molly.
"Why, she quite lags behind the others. I
wonder what is the matter."</p>

<p>"Run up to her with that paper in your hand
and tell her everything," said Cecil. "Get her
to walk behind with you; your news will soon
revive her. Run at once, Molly; I will undertake
to manage the other girls."</p>

<p>Molly set wings to her feet. She soon joined the
botanists, who stopped and began to talk eagerly.</p>

<p>"I hope you've had success," said Molly.
"Why, what's the matter, Kate?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," said Kate abruptly.</p>

<p>Her face was very pale; there were great black
shadows under her eyes.</p>

<p>"We can't think what's the matter with her,"
said Lucy Rae, one of the botanists. "She was
as lively as the best of us until we were coming
home."</p>

<p>"I have a headache; it will soon pass off,"
said Kate. "Don't take any notice of me; I
shall soon be quite my ordinary self."</p>

<p>"I want to say something to you, Kate," said
Molly suddenly.</p>

<p>Kate looked at her with irritation.</p>

<p>"I am not in the mood to discuss things," she
said; "it is quite true that I have a bad headache."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>"I won't worry you, dear," said Molly, in her
gentlest tones. "Let us walk slowly behind the
others."</p>

<p>Kate opened her lips to protest.</p>

<p>Then she changed her mind. She raised her
hand to her head, brushing it across her forehead
in a bewildered manner. Cecil drew the other
girls on, and Molly and Kate were alone.</p>

<p>"Kate," said Molly, the instant this was the
case, "I am so happy I can scarcely speak
rationally. The load is lifted from my mind. I
have found out everything. You would not
believe me yesterday when I told you that I
never betrayed our confidence."</p>

<p>"I don't remember about yesterday," said
Kate.</p>

<p>She turned round and gazed full at Molly.
Molly stepped back and stared at her in astonishment.</p>

<p>"You don't remember what you said to me?"
she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"No; I can't remember anything. Oh, how
my head aches! I feel sick and giddy."</p>

<p>"Lean on me, Kate. What is the matter with
you? You look dreadfully ill. Has anything
happened? Oh, I thought you'd be so happy
when I told you!"</p>

<p>"Don't tell me anything just now, Molly.
The fact is, I can't listen. Oh, my head, my
head!"</p>

<p>"But just let me say this much. I'm dreadfully
sorry you've a headache, but just listen to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
this much. Cecil has discovered everything.
Matilda was at the bottom of the whole matter."</p>

<p>"Matilda!" repeated Kate. She looked quite
dazed. "What about her?"</p>

<p>"Kate, she listened behind the summerhouse;
she overheard all our conversation. There was
a hole in the wood; she listened through that
hole. She heard all your story, all about your
grandfather and&mdash;&mdash; Kitty, darling, what <i>is</i> the
matter? How ghastly you look! Let me help
you across the road to this bench. Sit down;
lean against me."</p>

<p>There was a stone bench at the opposite side
of the road. Molly led Kate to it. She sank
down, sick and trembling.</p>

<p>"I'm dreadfully sorry you've such a frightful
headache," continued Molly; "but are you not
glad?"</p>

<p>"To tell you the truth, Molly," replied Kate,
"I don't know what you are talking about. You
want to tell me something, but I want to tell you
something else, far, far more badly. Something
has happened, Molly, and I will tell you while I
remember it. The feeling in my head is so
dreadful that I don't believe I shall be able to
remember anything long. Do you see these
ferns in my hand&mdash;this sort; it is very rare. I
wanted to get it, I was determined to get it. It
grows high on the rocks by the shepherd's
meadow. I would climb up. The other girls
had left me, they were botanizing on their own
account a little way off. I gathered some specimens;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
then I stretched out my hand for a very
fine frond, I&mdash;I lost my balance&mdash;I fell on my
head. I didn't remember anything for a bit. I
suppose I was stunned. After a time I got
better. I thought the dreadful pain and giddiness
would pass off. I managed to walk toward
the other girls. I determined to tell them nothing.
But, oh, Molly, I feel so sick now, so
dreadfully ill! Don't talk to me just now, for I
really can't listen. It worries me even to see you
so earnest and excited. May I lean on you?
Can you help me to get home?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Molly, "I'll do all in the world
I can for you, but you must not try to walk with
only my help. Just rest where you are, Kitty;
lean back, close your eyes. I'll run after Cecil
and call her."</p>

<p>"No, don't! I can't bear the others to know.
I did wrong when I climbed those high rocks;
I broke one of Miss Forester's rules. She makes
it a condition that we shall do nothing dangerous.
The others mustn't know. If only I can manage
to get home and go to bed, I shall be all right
to-morrow. Don't speak to me at all for a
minute."</p>

<p>As Kate said these last words, she leaned up
against the stone wall by which the bench stood,
and closed her eyes. After a time she grew
better: the terrible giddiness and acute pain
passed; she was able to take Molly's arm and go
slowly in the direction of Redgarth.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.<br />

<small>THE PROMISE IN THE CATHEDRAL.</small></h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-t.jpg" width="59" height="58" alt="T" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi2">THERE was consternation at St. Dorothy's:
Kate O'Connor was ill; on her
arrival home, she was almost unconscious.
The doctor was hastily summoned;
she was ordered to bed. Miss Leicester
had a room made up in the quietest part
of the house; she was moved there, and Molly
begged hard to be allowed to nurse her. At first
everyone hoped that a night's rest would put
her right, but the next day the doctor said something
about concussion of the brain. He said
absolute quiet was necessary; he would not even
allow her to be moved to the sanatorium. A
trained nurse was sent for, and the girls began
to walk about the house with hushed steps and
pale, anxious faces.</div>

<p>"The worst of it all is," said Molly to Hester,
"that if she thinks at all, poor Kate still believes
that I have been unfaithful to her."</p>

<p>"Oh, she does not think of anything specially
now," said Hester. "When she is well enough,
you must tell her; you must not fret, Molly."</p>

<p>"I can't help it," answered Molly. "I loved
Kate very, very dearly, and now she is ill, very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
ill; and her last thought of all must have been
that I was unworthy of her friendship."</p>

<p>"Well, it is a good thing that Cecil and I
know the truth now," said Hester, in a cheerful
tone. "What Kate wants is rest; she will be
herself in a few days, I make not the slightest
doubt; then we'll manage to tell what a stanch,
little thing you are, Molly. By the way, I do
think Cecil a splendid girl. How cleverly she
got that horrid Matilda to own up to her sneaking,
detestable, sly ways! Certainly Cecil has
done Matilda a lot of good; she has taken all
the conceit out of her. I only do wish something
would induce her to leave the school.
Fancy a girl like that coming to St. Dorothy's!
If Miss Leicester really knew what sort of girl
she is, I think she would ask Miss Forester not
to admit her."</p>

<p>At that moment Miss Leicester came into the
room where the two girls were talking.</p>

<p>"How is Kate now?" said Hester, going up at
once to the principal.</p>

<p>Miss Leicester's face was pale and grave.</p>

<p>"She is very ill," she answered.</p>

<p>"What do you mean by that?" asked Molly,
who felt her heart beating with a quick, nameless
sort of dread. "Do you mean that&mdash;that Kate
is in danger?"</p>

<p>"She is very ill," repeated Miss Leicester.
"Yes, I suppose there is danger; I fear there is
no doubt about it. The doctor has just left; she
is unconscious. She must have had a very bad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
fall. Molly, my dear, she spoke to you about
it: did she give you any idea of the height from
which she fell? None of the other girls are able
to give us any information."</p>

<p>"She only said that she had fallen," answered
Molly, "and that the fall stunned her. She
hoped that she would be all right after a little,
and did not wish the others to know."</p>

<p>"I am not surprised at that," replied Miss
Leicester; "she disobeyed a very strict rule.
That is the last sort of thing I should have
expected from Kate."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't be angry with her now!" said
Molly, tears filling her brown eyes.</p>

<p>"No, poor dear child!" said Miss Leicester.
"The whole thing is very miserable, and to complicate
matters, Nurse Wilkins has been taken
ill herself, and has been obliged to leave suddenly.
We hope to get another nurse by this
evening, for the doctor has telegraphed to London,
but in the meantime&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, let me go to her!" cried Molly.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you may help a little presently,
Molly," said Miss Leicester, looking at her
earnestly. "I have noticed that you have a
very gentle way, dear; but at present Cecil is
with her."</p>

<p>"Cecil!" exclaimed both girls.</p>

<p>"Yes; it seems that Cecil knows a good deal
about illness; she nursed her mother through a
very long illness. She came to the door to
inquire for Kate just when poor Nurse Wilkins<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
had to leave. She came in as if there were nothing
unusual the matter, and took her place by
Kate's side. Kate was moving her hands restlessly
and plucking at the bed-clothes, which is
such a bad sign in illness, and Cecil took both
her hands and held them, and then she grew
quiet. Perhaps you may help after a little,
Molly; but I should be sorry to disturb such an
excellent nurse as Cecil at present."</p>

<p>Miss Leicester left the room, and Molly, sinking
down on the nearest chair, burst into tears.</p>

<p>"If Kate dies I shall never feel happy again,"
she said, with a sob.</p>

<p>"But she won't die," said Hester; "she's a
great deal too strong and young. Why,"&mdash;Hester
wore a troubled look,&mdash;"she's only just seventeen.
Girls of seventeen don't die merely from a
fall. She's bad, but she'll soon be better. Don't
cry, Molly!"</p>

<p>"Girls often die," cried Molly. "Oh, Hester!
can nothing be done to save her? I wonder if
Miss Forester knows how bad she really is."</p>

<p>Hester went up to one of the windows and
began to drum her fingers on the glass.</p>

<p>"It's all wretched," continued Molly. "I
can't tell you what I feel, Hetty. If only Miss
Leicester would let me help in any way, I should
not feel so dreadful. I feel, somehow or other,
as if <i>I</i> were responsible for Kate's illness."</p>

<p>"Oh, now you are getting horridly morbid!"
said Hester. "What had you to do with it?"</p>

<p>"Nothing in one way, of course; but if all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
this had not happened, Kate would have gone
out with me, and not with the other girls, and I
would not have let her climb up that awful rock
just to get those miserable ferns. Oh, dear! I
thought I should be so happy at St. Dorothy's,
and now this seems to cast a blank over everything."</p>

<p>"The worst of it is," said Hester, after a
pause, "that even if Kate does get well&mdash;I don't
doubt that for a minute&mdash;even if she does get
well, she won't be allowed to study for a good
while, and then she'll lose her scholarship. I
know she has not a great deal of money. She
was quite certain of getting the scholarship, and
after that, of course, she could, by and by, take a
good position as a teacher. After a brain attack
of this sort, she won't be allowed to study for
some time. Of course one ought not to think of
that just now, but in Kate's position, where there
is not much money, it is, of course, important."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Molly. "I wish I were with her,"
she added. "One can scarcely think of examinations
at the present moment, can one, Hester?
Oh dear; oh, dear! I think I'll just creep upstairs
and see if I can help Cecil in any way."</p>

<p>Hester said nothing, and Molly left the room.</p>

<p>She went upstairs, turned down a long passage,
and at last paused before a door, over which a
heavy curtain had been hung. She turned the
handle very softly, and entered the room. All
the blinds were down; the light was shaded. At
first, Molly could hardly see; then she noticed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
Cecil's familiar figure seated by the head of the
bed. The figure on the bed was lying straight
and still; there was no movement or sound of any
sort. Kate looked at that moment as if she were
dead.</p>

<p>Molly crept up close to the bed; she did not
speak at all, nor did Cecil. Presently Cecil
stretched out her hand and touched Molly softly
on the arm. Molly knelt down close to Cecil.
Cecil began to stroke her hair, and, in some inexplicable
way, the younger girl felt soothed
and comforted by the gentle, firm touch. Kate
lay without movement; she scarcely seemed to
breathe.</p>

<p>"Is she dead?" asked Molly, in a tremulous
whisper.</p>

<p>"No," answered Cecil; "no&mdash;not yet."</p>

<p>"Cecil, she can't recover! no one could look
as dreadful as that&mdash;as still&mdash;as&mdash;as like marble
and recover."</p>

<p>"Don't talk," answered Cecil; "she may hear
us."</p>

<p>At that moment the room door was opened, and
Dr. Groves, the clever doctor who had undertaken
the case, came in; he was accompanied not only
by Miss Leicester, but Miss Forester. Miss
Forester gave a glance of surprise at Molly and
Cecil, and then turned to Miss Leicester.</p>

<p>"I thought you had got a trained nurse," she
said.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Miss Leicester, "but Nurse
Wilkins was suddenly taken ill. Cecil offered to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
help me until I could get someone from town. I
did not know that you were here, Molly Lavender."</p>

<p>Molly looked up with eyes of entreaty.</p>

<p>"Let me stay," she said. "I promise to be
perfectly quiet, and to do exactly what I am
told."</p>

<p>"Yes, let her stay," said the doctor. "There
is scarcely any nursing required at present; the
patient only requires watching. You may make
a little noise, if you like, girls. I don't like this
long-continued insensibility. I shall be glad of
anything to arouse my patient."</p>

<p>As he spoke he went to one of the windows and
drew up the blind. It was evening, and the western
sun streamed into the room. Some of its rays
fell across the foot of the bed where Kate lay.
Her long, black eyelashes lay heavy on her
cheeks, her rich profusion of brown hair was
flung back over the pillows, her face had a
deathly pale, almost waxen, hue; she breathed
so faintly that she scarcely seemed to breathe at
all. The doctor bent over her and, lifting the
eyelids, looked steadily into the eyes.
"Bring me a candle," he said suddenly.</p>

<p>Molly started up to fetch one. She returned
in a moment or two with a lighted candle in a
candlestick, and gave it to Dr. Groves. He
passed the light backward and forward before
Kate's eyes, she never seemed to flinch. He
dropped the lids again, and looked anxiously at
Miss Forester.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>"I should like to speak to you alone," he
said.</p>

<p>Miss Forester took him immediately into the
next room. The two girls sat where they were
left, with beating hearts. What was the verdict?
The doctor's face was very grave.</p>

<p>Miss Leicester, after a moment's hesitation,
followed Miss Forester and the doctor into the
next room. The girls, who were left behind,
heard earnest conversation, an ejaculation or
two from Miss Leicester; then footsteps going
downstairs; then a great silence&mdash;the motionless,
indifferent figure on the bed&mdash;the awful calm
which might mean the end of all things.</p>

<p>Miss Leicester came back presently into the
room, her eyes were red as if she had been crying.
She stood close to Kate, and looked down
at her; her eyes filled up with tears. Molly and
Cecil felt their hearts in their mouths.</p>

<p>"What is it?" said Molly at last; "don't&mdash;oh,
don't keep us in suspense any longer!"</p>

<p>"Come into the next room, Molly, and I will
tell you," said Miss Leicester. "Cecil, dear, you
shall hear afterward; but if you will stay now
quite quiet with dear Kate, you will be helping
us best."</p>

<p>Cecil nodded, her eyes were bright, she gave
Molly's hand a little squeeze, and Molly rose and
followed her mistress into the other room.</p>

<p>The moment she got there, she began to speak
with excitement.</p>

<p>"I know what you are going to tell me, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
I can't bear it," she said. "Don't tell me, don't!
Tell the others, but not me. I&mdash;I <i>can't</i> bear it!
There is the cathedral near&mdash;let me go there.
I&mdash;I know what you are going to say, but I
can bear it best if I am just alone in the cathedral."</p>

<p>"You are excited, Molly, and carried out of
yourself," said Miss Leicester. "That is not the
best way to meet trouble."</p>

<p>"No, no!" answered poor Molly, "I know
that. I am ashamed of myself. If things were
different, I should not mind quite so much, but
as they are&mdash;as they are&mdash;if Kate dies, I shall
never be happy again."</p>

<p>"You and Kate have not been as perfect
friends as you used to be," said Miss Leicester
suddenly.</p>

<p>"No," answered Molly, "that is true, that is
the bitter part of it all. Kate was angry with
me; believing what she did, she had reason to
be. I can't tell you, because it is a secret."</p>

<p>"Had it anything to do with Kate's speech on
her birthday?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but oh, please don't ask me any more!
for I've promised not to tell. If Kate were well
now, all would be explained, and all would be
happy. I had just got at the truth on Saturday
I had gone out to tell Kate, but Kate was suffering
then from the effects of her fall, and she
could not listen. She believes me to be guilty
now of what I never did. Oh, I shall never be
happy again if she dies!"</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>Miss Leicester laid her firm hand kindly on the
young girl's shoulder.</p>

<p>"It is a great trial for you, Molly, dear," she
answered. "No one can help you in a time of
trouble like this but God himself. Sometimes
God sends trouble of this kind, just to force us
to go direct to him. Perhaps that is the reason
why you are going through such a dark cloud,
dear Molly."</p>

<p>"But oh, tell me about Kate!" interrupted
Molly. "How selfish I am to think only of
myself! What does the doctor say of Kate?"</p>

<p>Miss Leicester paused for a minute.</p>

<p>"I cannot conceal the truth from you," she
said then. "At the present moment Kate's life
is in the greatest danger. Dr. Groves is anxious
to consult Sir John Williamson, a great London
specialist, about her case. He is going to telegraph
to him to come down to Redgarth, and we
hope he may arrive to-night. If Sir John
Williamson approves, Dr. Groves is inclined to
try a certain operation, which may remove the
pressure which is now injuring poor Kate's brain.
If the operation succeeds, she will get quickly
better; if not&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, is there any fear?" said Molly.</p>

<p>"There is," replied Miss Leicester; "it is a
very serious operation, but Dr. Groves recommends
it, because he thinks it is the only chance
of restoring Kate to health."</p>

<p>"And when will it be performed?" asked
Molly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>"In all probability Sir John Williamson will
perform it to-night. We have just heard that
an excellent nurse will be here between nine and
ten o'clock. The doctor can arrive by the midnight
train, and all may be satisfactorily over
before to-morrow morning. That is all I know
myself, dear Molly. Cecil and I will stay with
Kate until the nurse arrives. Perhaps you will
tell the others, dear. I trust to you to be brave
and calm, and to do what is right in every way.
We must have courage. Things look very dark
for Kate at present, but all hope is not yet withdrawn."</p>

<p>"Thank you for telling me," said Molly.
"Yes, I will try to be brave."</p>

<p>She went slowly out of the room.</p>

<p>In the passage she paused, and gave a longing
glance at the door over which the heavy curtain
was hung.</p>

<p>"Oh, Kate, Kate, you <i>must</i> live!" she said
aloud. "I will pray ever so hard for you. You
must not die, dear, darling Kate; I have asked
God to spare you, oh, I think he will, I think
he will!"</p>

<p>Molly went hastily to her room, and put on
her hat. She had a craving, which she could
scarcely account for, to be alone in the cathedral.
The doors were always open, anyone could go
in at any moment. Inside there was perfect
calm, a great peace, a great stillness. Molly
craved for this stillness now inexpressibly. She
managed to slip out of the house without anyone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
noticing her, and running down the broad
carriage-drive, soon reached the beautiful old
porch. She went in, heard the swinging doors
close softly behind her, and going as far as some
of the free seats, entered one and threw herself
on her knees.</p>

<p>Up to the present Molly Lavender had had
what might be considered, in every sense of the
word, a happy life. Her mother had died
before she was old enough to understand her
loss. Her grandmother had treated her with
uniform affection and kindness. Judge Lavender,
although a peculiar, and in some ways a
selfish, man, had been good to his only child.
Molly had been happy at school. Hers was an
affectionate as well as an enthusiastic nature.
She had been liked by all her schoolfellows.
In particular she had been loved by Cecil Ross.
Molly had given quite a passion of girlish affection
to this friend of her childhood. Cecil and
Molly had been chums for many years now.</p>

<p>When Molly came to St. Dorothy's, she was
just in the humor to take up a fresh friendship.
She had never met anyone like Kate
before; Kate had fascinated her. Still, in her
heart of hearts she loved Cecil best, but there
was something about Kate's gay ways, her
brightness, her wit, her fun, which appealed to
a fresh side of Molly. Molly had been very
proud of Kate's confidence. She had held her
little head high when Kate confided in her and
made much of her. Then came the dreadful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
time of reaction&mdash;the time when Kate snubbed
Molly unmercifully. Molly Lavender was too
well born, too rich, too endowed with that sort
of things which girls esteem, to have had much
experience hitherto of snubbing. Schoolgirls
quickly find out whether their companions are
encased in the triple armor which good birth
joined to money confers. Molly was fifteen, but
she had never been really snubbed before. She
was astonished and puzzled. The fact that a
girl who was of no birth in particular had done
this, did not affect her. Molly was too true
a lady, in the best sense of the term, not to
recognize a real lady when she met her.</p>

<p>She loved Kate deeply, and her conduct hurt
her; it hurt her to the point of intense pain.
Kate's speech on her birthday had caused
Molly's ears to tingle and her heart to swell.
She had admired the proud girl, as she stood
before her schoolfellows and spoke of the old
poetry, the old charm, the old idyllic life, which
had passed away forever. Molly had longed
to stand by the side of this girl and show
every other girl in the school how noble and
splendid she was, but the girl herself had
repulsed her. The girl, with her own hands,
had cast Molly aside. Then had come the
explanation; the mystery was cleared. Molly
was innocent of the crime imputed to her. She
had been given the means to amply exonerate
herself; then she had met Kate, and Kate was
too ill to listen to her; and now, now Kate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
O'Connor, beautiful, good, talented, was about
to die.</p>

<p>Molly found herself face to face with her first
trouble. Many girls of her age had known
worse, but to Molly it was full of intense bitterness;
a pain which almost reached agony's point.
She was hopeless and frightened. It was awful
to meet death like this. Death, the invincible,
the inexorable! What right had death to come
and claim one so young, so full of life, so
eminently fitted to do good in the world?
Above all, what right had death to come and
snatch away Molly's friend?</p>

<p>"She mustn't die," sobbed the girl. "Oh,
please, God, don't let Kate die, make her better!
let the operation succeed. Give the doctors
great wisdom, give them skill, help them to save
her life. Oh, God, I am a miserable, weak girl,
but I do beg very hard for this&mdash;this <i>great</i> boon!
oh, do spare Kate's life! Oh, God, do listen to
me! if you will spare her life, I'll try very hard
to please you; I'll try to be <i>so</i> good; I will give
up my life to you. Oh, God, hear me! let it be
a bargain between us; spare Kate, and then I'll
give up my life to you."</p>

<p>Molly's prayer scarcely comforted her. Still
it excited her a good deal; she felt hopeful;
she wondered as she left the church if the great
God up in heaven, the Maker of all things in
heaven above and earth beneath, had heard her
little, childish prayer; if he was inclined to
consider her poor little bargain. She wondered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
she hoped; then she went slowly back to St.
Dorothy's.</p>

<p>Miss Leicester was not present at supper.
Molly found herself forced to take the head of
Kate's table. As she had heard the latest news
of Kate, she was immediately made the heroine
of the hour. All the other girls flocked round
her, asking eager questions in awe-struck voices.</p>

<p>"Is she really in danger, Molly?" asked
Hester.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Molly, "yes; but I can't talk of
it now."</p>

<p>"Oh, we must know everything!" said Amy.
"It is perfectly awful. Why, of course, we all
loved Kate better than anyone else in the house!
It did not matter a bit about her running about
barefooted long ago, nor her grandfather being
a sort of peasant king. Kate was just Kate,
and we all loved her; oh, she mustn't die!"</p>

<p>"Do sit down, Amy, and eat your supper,"
said poor Molly. "What is the good of our
saying that sort of thing? If God wishes it,
she will die; it all rests with God."</p>

<p>"Yes, that is true enough," said Hester.
"After all, none of us can do anything; let us
get over this horrid meal, and go into the drawing
room. For my part, I have no heart for
study to-night. I don't know if anyone else
has."</p>

<p>"Not I," answered Molly; "my notes and
everything must go to the wall. I simply can't
think of such stupid things as psychology and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
physiology, and all those awful inductions and
deductions, while my mind is in a whirl."</p>

<p>"Nor I, nor I!" said several other girls.</p>

<p>Supper proceeded in a mournful fashion, and
the girls trooped into the drawing room. The
pretty room looked cheerful enough, the
electric light burned brightly; the piano stood
invitingly open. Hester shuddered as she
passed it.</p>

<p>"To think that Kate was rattling out waltzes
on that piano not a week ago!" she said.
"Molly, come here; you have not half told us
what you know. Now, you must out with it
all, whether it pains you or not. What did the
doctor say?"</p>

<p>Molly made a struggle to swallow a great
lump in her throat.</p>

<p>"He said that Kate's life was in danger," she
answered. "A doctor is coming from London
to-night."</p>

<p>"Oh, mercy! then it must be serious," said
Alice Rae, a rosy-faced girl of nearly twenty.
"When my father died, a doctor came from
London. We all gave up hope when he was
sent for."</p>

<p>"Are you sure of your facts, Molly?" asked
Hester. "A London doctor costs a great deal,
and everyone knows that Kate is not well off."</p>

<p>"Well, a doctor has been sent for," said
Molly, "for Miss Leicester told me so. His
name is Sir John Williamson; he is a great
specialist on brain affections. Kate must have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
hurt her brain very badly when she fell. Miss
Leicester says there is something pressing on
the brain which causes Kate to be quite insensible.
Dr. Groves wants to perform an operation."</p>

<p>"Oh, horrors!" cried Mary Wilson, a room
fellow of Kate's. "Are you certain&mdash;positively
certain, Molly Lavender?</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Molly, who felt important
in spite of all her misery, while she was imparting
these ghastly details to her hearers. "Sir
John Williamson will be here to-night, and if
he agrees with Dr. Groves, they will perform
the operation."</p>

<p>"To-night!" cried Hester.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Molly, nodding. "Miss Leicester
says it will be all over in the morning, and
we shall know&mdash;we shall <i>know</i> whether&mdash;&mdash;"
Her lips quivered, her eyes sought the ground;
she found that she could not proceed with her
speech.</p>

<p>"Think of it, girls!" said Hester "Think of
its happening while we're all asleep!"</p>

<p>"No, I shan't sleep," said Molly.</p>

<p>"Nor I," echoed Amy.</p>

<p>"I am sure, if I do sleep, I shall have the
most terrific nightmares," cried another girl.
"Oh, dear Kate, what fun she was! Do you
remember the name she gave us all in the dormitory&mdash;the
Dwellers in Cubicles? Why, she made
quite a storm in the house with her proposal that
selfishness should be evicted. Oh, dear; oh, dear!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
but, somehow or other, I don't feel that she is
going to die."</p>

<p>"Nor I," said Hester, trying to speak cheerfully.
"Dr. Groves can't have at all given up
the case, or he wouldn't propose an operation.
You may be quite certain the London doctor will
soon set her right; let us try and be cheerful, let
us hope for the best."</p>

<p>"We might all of us remember Kate to-night
when we are praying," said Amy, turning scarlet
as she spoke.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, yes, of course!" said the others, in
the shy way in which schoolgirls allude to their
deepest feelings.</p>

<p>"I wonder if Miss Leicester will come down to
prayers," said Amy, after a pause.</p>

<p>"I don't know; perhaps there won't be any,"
said Hester. "How I wish," she added, with a
sudden, vindictive smile, "that <i>horrid</i> Matilda
were here!"</p>

<p>"Little wretch!" cried Amy. "Why should
we be inflicted with her at this moment? Surely
we have trouble enough."</p>

<p>"But for her it would never have happened,"
said Hester.</p>

<p>"Now, what in the world do you mean,
Hetty?" cried half a dozen voices.</p>

<p>Hester looked mysterious. Molly's face became
very white.</p>

<p>"I am bound in honor not to tell, girls,"
said Hester. "You must take the hint for
what it is worth, and draw your own conclusions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
You have observed a cloud between Kate
and Molly."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, of course we have!" cried half a
dozen voices.</p>

<p>"Well, Matilda was at the bottom of it; I
can't tell you particulars. But for Matilda,
Kate mightn't have gone on that botany expedition.
But for Matilda, Molly, at least, would
have accompanied her. There might not have
been an accident; Kate might be well and happy,
and working hard for her scholarship at the
present moment."</p>

<p>"You make me burn with curiosity, Hester,"
cried Amy.</p>

<p>"I dare say, well, I can tell no more."</p>

<p>"You've told too much," said Molly.</p>

<p>"Have I? Well, I'll be mum. Only listen to
me, girls. Matilda is coming to St. Dorothy's."</p>

<p>"Yes; worse luck!" groaned one or two.</p>

<p>"When she comes, let's boycott her," said
Amy suddenly.</p>

<p>"What fun!" cried the others, clapping their
hands. Molly covered her face with hers.</p>

<p>She thought of her bargain in the cathedral;
of her prayer to God, of her vow to give herself
up to him absolutely, if only he would spare
Kate. Did this kind of talk please him? Were
uncharitableness, vindictiveness, revenge, the
sort of things he delighted in?</p>

<p>"Oh," she said, rising to her feet, and speaking
with an effort, "it frightens me to hear you
talking like that, girls. If Matilda is bad, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
have no right to try and make her worse. Oh,
I did hate her myself, but I mustn't! I must get
over it. Think of Kate&mdash;think of that beautiful
picture she drew for us."</p>

<p>"Yes, poor darling," said Amy, with a sob.
"I shall never forget how she looked when she
talked of her grandfather, the peasant king, and
the little cottage, and the flowers, and the sweet
life she used to lead."</p>

<p>"Well, do let us forget about Matilda," said
Molly. "If we can't think kindly of her,&mdash;and I
find it very hard to think kindly,&mdash;let us try not
to think of her at all; at least not to-night."</p>

<p>Hester stared very hard at Molly. When, by
and by, the other girls had dispersed, Hester
came up to Molly, and said in a low voice: "I
don't understand you; I thought you hated
Matilda."</p>

<p>Molly looked at her with frightened eyes.</p>

<p>"Oh, I do!" she said; "but I want to <i>un</i>hate
her."</p>

<p>"Molly, you've no right to coin words."</p>

<p>"It expresses what I mean," said Molly.</p>

<p>"But you have not told me your true
thought," said Hester; "what is it?"</p>

<p>"I am afraid of doing anything the least bit
wrong to-night," said Molly again. "I think it
may make a difference about Kate."</p>

<p>"I don't understand you," said Hester.</p>

<p>But Molly did not explain.</p>

<p>Miss Leicester came down at ten o'clock for
prayers. The girls all stood up while she read<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
the evening hymn; as a rule they sang it, but
there could be no singing at St. Dorothy's to-night.
At the end of her short prayer, she said
a word or two about Kate.</p>

<p>"Spare her, if possible, O Father," said the
principal, in her solemn voice; "but, oh, in any
case help us to say, Thy will be done."</p>

<p>"I can't say it; I can't!" whispered poor
Molly, to her own struggling heart. "Oh, God!
please remember what I promised to you in the
cathedral."</p>

<p>Then she went upstairs with the others.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII.<br />

<small>SUSPENSE.</small></h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-t.jpg" width="59" height="58" alt="T" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi2">THE night passed somehow. When
Molly laid her tired head on her pillow
she fell asleep. She awoke quickly,
however, aroused by the sound of
wheels on the gravel sweep outside the silent
house. Remembrance came quickly to her, and
she knew what had happened, the great
specialist from London had arrived. Molly
wondered if Cecil would perhaps come to visit
her. Her heart began to beat wildly; she sat up
in bed. Kate's room was in a distant part of the
house, but the sound of rather heavy footsteps
coming up the stairs came distinctly to Molly's
ears; they died away in the distance. Once
again there was silence; it was broken, at long
intervals, by the hurried closing of a door, by
rapid but quiet footsteps, then again followed
the awful, awful quiet&mdash;that sort of quiet which
tries a young and anxious heart as nothing else
can do in all the world.</div>

<p>Molly lit her candle; she took down a book of
history from her shelves, and tried in vain to
read; her eyes followed the printed words without
in the least taking in their sense.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>"'In tracing the history of nations,'" she read,
"'we discover a threefold purpose&mdash;&mdash;'"</p>

<p>"Kate, dear; oh, beautiful Kate!" cried
Molly's heart.</p>

<p>The book seemed full of Kate; all the ancient
story sank down into the depths of the paper,
and Kate's history and Kate's danger seemed
alone to fill the closely written pages. Molly
shut up the book, and clasped her hands.</p>

<p>"How I wish Cecil would come to me!" she
moaned once or twice.</p>

<p>The little clock on her mantelpiece struck the
hour of midnight. The sound was echoed outside
by the big cathedral clock, then the chimes
rang out. Molly shuddered as she thought of
the cathedral, where she had prayed, and of her
vow to God. Perhaps God was angry with her
for trying to make a sort of compact with him.
Oh, what was right? What was the good of
prayer? If one could not pray in one's extremity,
what was one to do? Molly felt frightened as
she remembered her vow. Oh, why did not Cecil
come to her? How could she keep her senses,
lying there in her little bed, while Kate was perhaps
traveling along that valley from which there
was no return? Molly wondered, as the night
went on, if Kate would be afraid to die, but then
she remembered that Kate would know nothing
about it until after she was dead. She wondered
if she would be frightened then, and how her
spirit would feel without her body. She wondered
if the old grandfather, who was so good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
and noble and sweet, would come to meet the
girl he loved in the other world, and would lead
her gently away up to the throne of God himself.
And then she wondered if God would smile at
poor Kate, and tell her that he had thought over
everything, and saw quite clearly that her life
down here would be too full of struggle, and so
he had called her early to a happier home.</p>

<p>Here Molly's reflections caused her to burst
into bitter sobs. She was sobbing loudly when
her room door was suddenly opened, and Cecil
came in.</p>

<p>"Oh, Cecil, Cecil! what news!" cried Molly.
"Oh, Cecil, how I have longed for you! do tell
me quickly what news, what has happened?
Cecil, is she&mdash;is she dead?"</p>

<p>"No," said Cecil; "no!"</p>

<p>"Oh, come and sit by me, Ceci, and put your
arms round me, I am so miserable, and so, so
<i>frightened!</i> Come over here; let me feel your
touch."</p>

<p>"Why, you want some sal volatile; you are
quite unstrung," said Cecil.</p>

<p>"But oh, do tell me what news!"</p>

<p>"Well, they are going to perform the operation."</p>

<p>"Oh, isn't it over yet?"</p>

<p>"No; they are just going to begin."</p>

<p>"And have you been sent away?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I can do nothing further. Miss Leicester
is there, and Miss Forester has come."</p>

<p>"Oh, I can't, <i>can't</i> stand it!" said Molly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
"Suppose she wakes and screams&mdash;suppose it
hurts her frightfully."</p>

<p>"No, it won't, they are going to give her
chloroform. Molly, you must try and control
yourself. It is selfish, too, to make a fuss just
now."</p>

<p>"I know it is," said Molly; "but I have been
alone so long, and I have got so fearfully nervous.
I don't mind half so much now you are here.
You will stay with me, won't you, Cecil?"</p>

<p>"I will, if you like; I will lie down beside you,
if you like."</p>

<p>"Oh, I can't sleep; I can't think of it! Do
talk to me. What did Sir John Williamson
say?"</p>

<p>"I don't know; I did not hear. They are
going to perform the operation; it will take a
little over an hour."</p>

<p>"And then?" said Molly.</p>

<p>"Then they will know," answered Cecil.</p>

<p>"Oh, Cecil! how soon after?"</p>

<p>"Very soon, Miss Forester says. I heard her
telling Miss Leicester that Dr. Williamson is certain
there is a small piece of bone pressing on
the brain. If that can be successfully removed
without injuring the brain in any way, Kate will
recover consciousness, and then there is no reason
why she should not quickly get better."</p>

<p>"Do you think she'll get better, Cecil?"</p>

<p>"How can I say? I hope so."</p>

<p>"Have you&mdash;have you prayed about it,
Cecil?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, of course."</p>

<p>"So have I," continued Molly; "I prayed in
church. I can't believe it was a very good
prayer, and I can't make it any better. Miss
Leicester prayed too, but she prayed differently.
Miss Leicester said: 'Thy will be done.' I did
not say that. I&mdash;I made a vow."</p>

<p>"Dear little Molly," said Cecil, "I never saw
you so excited in all your life before. What
vow did you make?"</p>

<p>"I promised to give myself up to God. I
thought I would go as a missionary, or something,
if only he would make Kate well. Was
it wrong of me to pray like that, Cecil?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," answered Cecil.</p>

<p>She sat quiet and still on the edge of Molly's
bed. Her strong face was quite pale, her eyes
were calm and steadfast, her lips wore a gentle,
chastened sort of look. Molly, who was in a
fever of excitement and misery, could not help
gazing at her in wonder.</p>

<p>"Are you not very anxious?" she asked.</p>

<p>"To a certain extent I am, Molly, but there is
no use in losing my self-control. I don't think
we two girls can do anything more in this matter,
just now. If you don't rest, you will be ill; and
that will cause a lot of fresh trouble and misery
to a great many people. I will give you a little
sal volatile, and then you must lie down, and I
will hold your hand, and perhaps you will fall
asleep."</p>

<p>"I can't sleep."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>"You must try. I won't stay with you, if you
talk any more."</p>

<p>"Oh, then, I'll stay perfectly quiet! but I
know I shan't sleep."</p>

<p>Cecil prepared the sal volatile, and bringing it
to Molly's side, made her drink it. Then she
straightened the bed-clothes, and, laying her cool
hand on Molly's hot forehead, sat down beside
her. In spite of herself the tired girl's heavy
eyes closed, and she slept.</p>

<p>It was quite early in the morning when she
awoke. Cecil was still seated by her bedside.
She started up with a cry.</p>

<p>"Oh, Cecil, what has happened? Is she&mdash;is
she alive? I have been dreaming about her all
night. Have you&mdash;have you heard anything?"</p>

<p>"No; but we might go and inquire now," said
Cecil.</p>

<p>Molly sprang eagerly out of bed.</p>

<p>"Oh, you darling! Let us go immediately!"
she cried.</p>

<p>She put on her dressing gown, and, taking
Cecil's hand, stole softly with her out of the
room. The long corridors were all deserted;
the first dawn of the cold daylight was creeping
in through the windows; the cheerful house
looked ghastly and deserted. Molly shivered as
she accompanied Cecil to the door of Kate's
room. The girls had just reached the door when
Dr Groves came out.</p>

<p>"Oh, sir!" cried Molly, "oh, please tell
me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>"Tell you what, my dear?" said the doctor
kindly.</p>

<p>"Is she&mdash;is she dead?" said Molly.</p>

<p>"Dead? Not a bit of it," said the doctor.
"I am glad to tell you that my patient is better
this morning. Oh, my dear child, what is the
matter? Pray don't make any noise outside
this door."</p>

<p>For Molly had burst into such a choking fit of
sobs that her self-control was in danger of giving
way.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.<br />

<small>CONSECRATED.</small></h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-s.jpg" width="59" height="59" alt="S" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi2">SIX weeks after the events mentioned
in the last chapter, Kate O'Connor
had very nearly recovered her normal
state of health. She was still at St.
Dorothy's, but the doctor had forbidden all return
to work until after Christmas. Christmas
was drawing near now, and the girls were talking
a good deal about it. Matilda Matthews had
been an inmate of St. Dorothy's for three or four
weeks. The boycotting idea had been quite
abandoned. Molly was the one who put a stop
to that; she had been consistently kind to
Matilda from the first. Matilda had shrunk
from Molly, and was rather surprised when the
young girl came to meet her on the evening of
her arrival, talked to her pleasantly, and did her
best to make her feel at home and at ease.
Matilda was given a very nice room to herself,
and Molly suggested to her that she should
invite some girl who was going in for the same
branch of study to share it with her in the
evenings.</div>

<p>"Such a step will make you popular," said
Molly; "besides being a kind thing to do."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't care a straw about being kind," answered
Matilda frankly, "although I should
naturally like to be popular. I did not know
you were the good-natured sort you seem to be,
Molly Lavender. I thought you'd hate and
detest me after the shabby way I treated you;
but as you are inclined to be agreeable, I am
quite willing to meet you halfway. I may as
well tell you now that I never took particularly
to you, but I was much impressed by Cecil Ross,
and if she were not quite the shabbiest girl in
the world, I should wish to be her chum. Well,
say now, why should not you and I be chums&mdash;chums
for life, I mean. You don't want to share
my room, but I can do all kinds of odd things
for you. I can be awfully good-natured to girls
who <i>really</i> cotton to me; and when you go to
London&mdash;&mdash; You live in London, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes; with my grandmother," answered
Molly.</p>

<p>"Oh, I expect you have a horribly dull time!
My father has a house in Portman Square. You
shall come and drive with me in the carriage;
and oh, say, wouldn't it be prime if I coaxed
father to give a ball at Christmas, and I invited
you to it?"</p>

<p>"I am not out yet," answered Molly, "so I
do not think grandmother would allow me
to go."</p>

<p>"Well, I mean a children's ball; you are not
too old to enjoy it, are you?"</p>

<p>"I am fifteen&mdash;not at all too old; but I don't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
think grannie will wish me to leave her in the
evenings."</p>

<p>"Your people are very rich, aren't they?"</p>

<p>"I believe they are; but what does that
matter?"</p>

<p>"What does that matter!" echoed Matilda,
with a curl of her lips. "Dear, dear! I think
you must have taken leaves out of Kate O'Connor's
book. By the way, they say&mdash;stoop down
and I'll whisper to you&mdash;that that young lady
will be obliged to stoop to charity, after all;
that sainted grandfather of hers did not leave
her much money, and her illness has swallowed
up a considerable portion of what was reserved
for her educational expenses here."</p>

<p>"Surely that is not our affair."</p>

<p>Molly turned scarlet as she spoke; she had to
place the most violent control upon herself to
remain another moment by Matilda's side.</p>

<p>"I do want to be good to you," she said. "I
am sure we all at St. Dorothy's want to be good
to you, Matilda,&mdash;at least, I think we all do,&mdash;but
oh, please, if you wish to have a nice time
here, you must give up that sort of thing."</p>

<p>"What sort of thing?" asked Matilda.</p>

<p>"You must not repeat what you think other
people have said; you must try hard not to
make mischief. As to Kate, I will not listen to
a word against her; in fact, I won't talk about
her to you at all."</p>

<p>"Oh, hoity toity!" said Matilda, tossing her
head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>Molly soon afterward left her.</p>

<p>"How am I to be kind to such an awful girl?"
she whispered to her own heart, but then she
remembered her vow to God. She was trying
with all her might to keep it, but nothing seemed
quite right.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was within a week of the end of the term,
when, one morning, Molly received a letter from
her grandmother. It ran as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">My Dear Molly:</span></div>

<p>You will be wondering what I intend you to do during
the Christmas vacation which is now so close at hand, and
you will doubtless be preparing for your usual time with
me. Well, my dear child, I am sorry to disappoint you.
I know, darling, that you love me very much, and it is a
great pleasure to me to have you; but, after careful consideration,
I have made up my mind that I must not have
that pleasure this Christmas. It would be very selfish of
me to have you in the house, Molly, for I could do little or
nothing to give you pleasure while you were with me.
My health, my dear child, is not what it was; I suffer
terribly from insomnia, and can stand none of that noise
and racket in which the young delight. In short, it would
be very wrong to mope you up with an old woman, Molly.
My faithful servant, Pearson, attends to all my wants; my
doctor visits me daily. I have a full measure of that peace
and calm, that quiet and rest, which are now my sole ideas
of earthly happiness. You must not, therefore, fret about
me, dear, for I am as well as an old woman of over eighty
can be. This letter is to tell you, dear Molly, that you are
not to spend Christmas with me. Have you any idea what
you would like to do with yourself? Your letters from St.
Dorothy's interest me very much. I delight in reading<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
about your life, dear, for I can do so without in the least
exciting myself. I always thought highly of Cecil Ross,
and what you say about the Irish girl, Kate O'Connor gives
me much pleasure. I told you all about my little scheme,
Molly, for endowing girls who are ladies, and really want
a good start in life. From certain things you tell me, it is
possible that I may be able to assist Kate materially in the
future. I can say nothing about that at present, but I wish
you clearly to understand that I take an interest in her. I
hope she will quite recover from her serious accident.
What an escape she had of her life, poor child! what an
awful operation she must have gone through! My dear
Molly, what do you think of the following idea? Suppose
you and Kate arrange to spend your Christmas with Cecil.
Cecil will, of course, want to join her brothers, and you
might all keep house together for a month. You can talk
this over with Cecil, and let me know. Please understand
that, in any arrangement of this kind, I consider myself
responsible for the expenses. Why not go to the seaside?
Some people enjoy the sea at Christmas. A complete change
of that sort will do you all good, and a lot of young things
together can knock up a good deal of fun&mdash;at least, I used
to find that the case in those days in the dim past when I
was young. Let me know what you settle, my darling,
and believe me,</p>

<div class='sig'>
<span style="margin-right: 4em;">Your affectionate grandmother,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Mary Lavender.</span><br />
</div></blockquote>

<p>Molly read this letter with a quickly beating
heart and flushed cheeks; she plunged it into
her pocket, and danced rather than walked down
to breakfast. Kate O'Connor had no home to go
to, and Miss Forester had asked her to remain
on at Redgarth if no better offer turned up.
Kate had not yet recovered her usual color, nor
were her eyes so bright as of old, she was gentle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
and affectionate to everyone, but a good deal of
her high spirit had deserted her.</p>

<p>When Molly had an opportunity she spoke to
Kate about the old trouble, but Kate's illness
had made all that time seem rather dim to her,
and although she was now very fond of Molly,
something of the old <i>verve</i> had left her friendship.</p>

<p>"But it will be all right, more than right,
when I get her away to the seaside," thought
Molly to herself. "Oh, what a splendid idea
it is!"</p>

<p>"Molly, what are you thinking about?" asked
Cecil, as Molly ate her bread and butter and
smiled to herself.</p>

<p>"You might as well give us a share of your
happy thoughts," said Hester. "You can't
possibly know how comical you look, eating and
smiling and nodding, and never letting out a
word."</p>

<p>"I have had such a jolly letter," answered
Molly.</p>

<p>"From whom? Do tell us!"</p>

<p>"From grannie, of course."</p>

<p>"Oh, you are going to her for Christmas, are
you not?"</p>

<p>"Well, no; I am not," answered Molly. "I
can't talk about my letter now. Cecil and Kate,
shall we meet and have a little consultation after
dinner to-day?"</p>

<p>"It is a half-holiday, so of course we can,"
replied Cecil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>"And am I not to be in the conference?" interrupted
Hester.</p>

<p>"No, I'm afraid you are not, but we'll tell
you all about it afterward," said Molly.</p>

<p>She did not add another word, but, having
finished her breakfast, left the room abruptly.</p>

<p>"Where are you going to spend your Christmas,
Kate?" asked Hester.</p>

<p>"Here, I suppose," said Kate.</p>

<p>"You will have a dull time, you poor thing!"</p>

<p>"Oh, no! I shall like it. It is so kind of Miss
Forester."</p>

<p>But Kate sighed somewhat heavily as she
spoke.</p>

<p>"Well, I do pity you," said Amy. "Fancy
staying on here with all the girls away. Even if
you could study&mdash;but you are not allowed to do
that yet."</p>

<p>"I shall be all right," said Kate. "I must
have patience."</p>

<p>She did not add any more, but went out of the
room.</p>

<p>Cecil and Hester found themselves alone.</p>

<p>"I wish I could do something for her," said
Cecil; "but I can't. I'd give anything to invite
her to stay with the boys and myself; but the
only lodgings we can secure at Hazlewick are so
small and poor that I could not possibly ask her
to share them. Poor dear Kate! when I look at
her I do long for money."</p>

<p>"Well, you will have plenty of money some
day, Cecil," said Hester. "You have but to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
cultivate those wonderful brains of yours, and
you will be able to do anything. You don't
know what Miss Forester and Miss Leicester
think of you, and for that matter, all the professors;
they say you will pass your B.A. brilliantly
by and by, and after that, of course, you
can take up anything."</p>

<p>"I have a great deal to work for," said Cecil.
"How quickly this term has gone! Of course I
shall love to be back with the boys; but I shall
be glad, too, when we can return to our life here.
But for the anxiety about Kate, I could have
done better than I have done. During the worst
part of her illness, I could scarcely think of my
studies at all."</p>

<p>"You ought to be a nurse or a doctor or something,"
said Hester. "Miss Leicester says you
would make a splendid lady doctor; she said
she never saw anyone so young with such self-control."</p>

<p>"By the way," said Cecil, "I wonder if that
report is really true about Kate."</p>

<p>"What report?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps I ought not to speak of it, but I
know you are her friend, Hester."</p>

<p>"Rather; I'd do anything for her," said
Hester Temple.</p>

<p>"Well, it was Alice Wright, who lives at
Dacre House, who told me, and Alice is a very
careful sort of girl. She knows a cousin of
Kate's, a Mr. Dixon; he is a solicitor in London,
and Alice's mother wrote to tell her that Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
Dixon has gone bankrupt, and that poor Kate's
little money has been all swallowed up in the
smash. I don't think Kate knows herself, but
Alice says it is perfectly true, and that Miss
Forester is carefully considering the case. She
is so fond of Kate that nothing would induce her
to cast her off, and, besides, Kate is still too
weak to bear any shock. At the same time, Miss
Forester can't keep her here if she has no money
to pay her fees. If Kate were in her usual health,
she is so full of pluck that she could stand anything,
even a reverse of this sort. I wonder what
Miss Forester will do; it would be perfectly horrid
for Kate to feel that she was here on charity."</p>

<p>"Well, don't say anything about it," said
Hester. "I expect something will be arranged
during the vacation, and we shall know when we
meet next term."</p>

<p>Cecil left the breakfast room feeling rather
depressed. She went shortly afterward to
school, and in the course of the morning, between
two lectures, came suddenly face to face with the
principal.</p>

<p>"My dear," said Miss Forester, in her genial
way, "are you well? You don't look quite as
bright as I should like to see you. I hope you
are not studying too hard; there is no use in
overdoing anything, even study, Cecil."</p>

<p>"No, I am not working too hard," said Cecil,
"but oh, if I might talk to you!" she added,
throwing emphasis and almost passion into her
words.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>Miss Forester laid her hand on her shoulder.</p>

<p>"You certainly may, my dear girl," she replied.
"Let me see. Molly Lavender is coming
to see me this evening. I have arranged to
give her half an hour at five o'clock, but if you
come to me at six, I shall be delighted to have a
chat with you. I am interested in you, Cecil.
If you go on as well as you have begun, you are
likely to do the school credit. Can you come at
six to-night?"</p>

<p>"I certainly can," replied Cecil. "I am
anxious to see you, but not about myself; I
want to say something about Kate O'Connor."</p>

<p>Miss Forester laughed.</p>

<p>"I am hearing about Kate O'Connor, morning,
noon, and night," she said. "All you St.
Dorothy girls seem to have gone wild about her.
Well, my dear, don't look so puzzled; I am very
fond of Kate; I will listen to anything you have
to say about her with great pleasure. I will expect
you at six this evening, Cecil."</p>

<p>Cecil ran off with a beaming face.</p>

<p>"Molly," she said, as they were going home
together, "I am in luck! I met Miss Forester
twenty minutes ago, and she invited me to go
and see her this evening. I told her that I
wanted to talk to her about Kate; I mean to
have everything out, if I can."</p>

<p>"Are you going to-night?" said Molly. "She
invited me to tea with her."</p>

<p>"Yes; I am to go afterward."</p>

<p>"And you mean to talk to her about Kate?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"What about her?"</p>

<p>"Well, her vacation for one thing, poor darling!
How is she to get better, living on all alone
here?"</p>

<p>"She needn't," said Molly, beginning to skip
as she walked; "it is all arranged in the most
beautiful, perfect way. I will just tell you now,
Cecil, for you can think it over during dinner,
and then we can discuss the thing in all its bearings
later on. Grannie&mdash;you know what a brick
she is?"</p>

<p>"I should rather think I do," said Cecil
warmly.</p>

<p>"Well," continued Molly, "she can't have me
this Christmas. That love for silence seems to
grow and grow upon her. The poor darling will
soon bring herself to such a pass that she won't
even be able to stand the creaking of a chair;
but what heavenly plan do you think she has
suggested? I am not to go to her, but I am to
have a jolly, jolly, merry, merry Christmas, for
all that. Oh, Cecil, and it will help you too,
and those boys of yours, and Kate! Oh, I think
it is just too perfect! I do think grannie has the
sweetest thoughts in all the world. Aren't you
quite delighted?"</p>

<p>"But you forget, you have not told me yet,"
said Cecil.</p>

<p>"Of course, no more I have. Well, listen:
we're all to be grannie's guests this Christmas,
not at her house in London, but somewhere at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
the seaside. Grannie will take lodgings for us,
and we are to be as jolly and merry as ever we
please. She has invited me, of course, and you
too, Cecil, and the four boys, and Kate, and she
thinks the seaside will do us good, even if it is
cold weather; and now all we have to decide on
is what part of the coast we will visit, and how
many rooms we will require, for grannie, who is
very rich, will pay everything, so that the horrid
money part needn't trouble any of us. Now,
Cecil, aren't you glad&mdash;aren't you delighted?"</p>

<p>"But it seems too much to take," said Cecil.</p>

<p>"Too much! Oh, if you're going to begin
that nonsense, I'll never speak to you again!
Don't waste words over it, Cecil, for you will
have to yield in the end, and you may as well
do it with a good grace."</p>

<p>"It will certainly be a good relief to Mr.
Danvers," said Cecil.</p>

<p>"Yes, of course; and, poor man, his feelings
ought to be a little considered. Of course you
will accept, Cecil; say 'yes,' this minute."</p>

<p>"I don't see how I am to refuse, Molly. It is
quite the most perfect idea I ever heard of in all
my life."</p>

<p>"Yes, isn't it? Won't grannie have a jolly
Christmas, even though she is all by herself.
Why, her heart will be just bubbling over with
contentment."</p>

<p>"But she would not like it to bubble," said
Cecil. "Oh, she is the dearest old lady in the
world! But Molly, darling, I very nearly lost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
my reason trying to stay quiet enough that day,
when she told me that she had left me five hundreds
pounds in her will."</p>

<p>"Well," said Molly, "I am too happy for
anything. We'll tell Kate after dinner, and
then you and I, Cecil, must arrange all about
the lodgings. We need deny ourselves nothing,
for grannie will want us to have a real good
time."</p>

<p>The girls had a consultation after dinner, or
rather, Molly harangued and arranged, and
Kate and Cecil sat by and listened, with sparkling
eyes and flushed cheeks. Much of Kate's
old high spirits returned to her for this auspicious
occasion. It turned out that she knew
a great deal more about the seaside than either
of the other girls, her home in Ireland being
within a mile of the coast. She suggested an
unfashionable seaside resort; she further added
that the sea was grandest in winter, when the
great storms came, and the waves were sometimes,
figuratively speaking, mountains high.
She described with great vividness a storm
which she and her grandfather had witnessed
on the broad Atlantic, how the great rollers
came dashing and breaking in, and the clouds
of spray wetted your face, even though you
stood many yards back from the raging sea.
Then she described a vessel on the rocks, and
the lowering of the lifeboat, and the rescuing
of the drowning people, and the man and the
little girl whom she and her grandfather took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
home that night; the terrible grief of the man,
whose wife had been drowned in the shipwreck,
and the feel of the little child's arms round
Kate's neck as she lay huddled up in her bed.</p>

<p>"But all that sounds perfectly awful," said
Molly, when Kate paused for breath.</p>

<p>"Yes, the shipwrecks are awful, but the sea
itself is magnificent," said Kate, "you can't
be near it without loving it. Oh, it will give
me a fresh lease of life to breathe the dear salt
air again!"</p>

<p>"Then the seaside is decided on," said Molly,
with emphasis; "and all we have to do is to find
a suitable place, not too fashionable. I wish we
could go as far away as Penzance or Falmouth,
but it seems scarcely worth while for such a
large party to take so long a journey; I must
think it all over very carefully. There is one
thing now I want to decide."</p>

<p>"What is that?" asked Cecil.</p>

<p>"Why, that we should leave all our books
behind, and just take a few good novels; one
or two of Sir Walter Scott's, a Dickens and a
Thackeray, and perhaps Miss Austen. Just let
us live for pleasure for a whole month. Oh, I
know it seems a wrong thing to say, but, for my
part, I think I shall study all the better when the
month is over, if I do not work during that time."</p>

<p>"Agreed," said Cecil, looking up wistfully.</p>

<p>"Ceci, I know you are pining to work that
brain of yours," said Molly, "but I am certain a
month's rest will be best."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>She looked full at Kate as she spoke.</p>

<p>Kate's eyes had suddenly assumed a wistful
look; she gave Molly a direct glance, and the
delicate rose color flooded her pale cheeks.</p>

<p>"I don't think it is fair to Cecil," she said
suddenly.</p>

<p>"If we all agree, what matter does it make to
Cecil?"</p>

<p>"But it does; it makes a great deal," continued
Kate. "I know perfectly well, Molly,
why you are proposing it, and I think it is very,
very good of you. You don't want me to feel
out of it; but I shan't, dear Molly; I shall try
and have patience. I know it is impossible for
me to compete in any way with you and Cecil
now."</p>

<p>"I see," interrupted Cecil suddenly. "I did
not know what Molly meant at the time. Yes,
it is a good thought; we'll all rest our brains.
Kate shall not even read, but we'll read aloud to
her, and so badly that she's certain to drop off
to sleep in a quarter of an hour; and you know,
Kate, the doctor said that sleep was better for
you than any medicine."</p>

<p>"I know," said Kate, with a sigh.</p>

<p>Her high spirits had vanished; she looked
paler than usual.</p>

<p>"I wish I did not feel so weary," she said.
"I wish this horrible depression, and good-for-nothingness
would leave me."</p>

<p>"It will when you are at the seaside," said
Molly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>"And I defy you to be very depressed in the
company of Maurice and Jimmy," continued
Cecil. "Oh, you have never met the boys; you
don't know what rascals they are, not Maurice&mdash;he
is a prince of boys&mdash;but the others."</p>

<p>"Yes, I can vouch for their all being the most
extraordinary and delightful quartet in the
world," said Molly, with a laugh. "Well, I
must go now: it is nearly five o'clock, and Miss
Forester has invited me to tea with her."</p>

<p>"Don't stay too long," called out Cecil.
"Remember, I am due at school at six."</p>

<p>"I shall give myself exactly half an hour by
the clock," replied Molly, with a smile.</p>

<p>She left the room, and, five minutes later, was
knocking at the door of Miss Forester's charming
sitting room.</p>

<p>"Come in!" called the principal.</p>

<p>Molly entered. Tea was on the table; Miss
Forester was seated by a desk, examining some
exercise books, she glanced round quickly when
Molly entered the room.</p>

<p>"Pour me out some tea, like a good girl," she
said; "then help yourself, and don't say a word
to me for a minute or two."</p>

<p>She turned once more to the work over which
she was busy. Molly poured out tea, helped
herself to a cup, and then gave many shy glances
at the principal's beautiful, tall, and slender
figure, her strong face, with its deep, dark eyes
and lovely expression.</p>

<p>"How good she looks!" thought the child,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
"how brave! she has the sort of expression
which a conqueror ought to wear, even to look
at her helps me. Oh, yes! I am sure she has had
many a fight, and I am also certain that she has
always come off victorious. I wish I could tell
her about that vow I made, and how very hard I
find it to keep it, and how frightened I am now
and then, when I wake in the night and think
about it. Perhaps if I don't faithfully keep it,
God will send some fresh punishment to poor
Kate; perhaps I did wrong to vow at all."</p>

<p>"Molly, child, what are you thinking about?"
said Miss Forester suddenly.</p>

<p>She rose as she spoke, came up to the fire, and
drew a little table luxuriously toward her; as
she did so, she gave Molly a penetrating glance.</p>

<p>"Bring your chair nearer, my dear," she said;
"you look, not exactly troubled, but anxious.
Now, I don't want my girls to be anxious.
What is the matter, Molly? have you anything
on your mind?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Molly; "I have."</p>

<p>Miss Forester was silent for a minute.</p>

<p>"I never force anyone's confidence," she then
said slowly, "but I am a middle-aged woman,
and you are a young girl. It is just possible that
my experience may be of value to you."</p>

<p>"I'd rather tell you than anyone else in the
world," replied Molly, with a sudden burst of
enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"Then why not, my dear child? you have
surely come here for the purpose, have you not?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
What is worrying you, my dear Molly Lavender?"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you as quickly as I can," said Molly
"You remember about Kate, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Kate O'Connor!" said Miss Forester, with a
laugh. "I am not likely to forget her, I find her
name in everybody's mouth."</p>

<p>"It was the time when Kate was ill," said
Molly; "that fearful day when Dr. Groves
thought she might never get better. Don't you
remember finding Cecil and me by her bedside?"</p>

<p>"I do, and I thought you had no business to
be there."</p>

<p>"Perhaps not," said Molly, coloring; "but I
was so restless and wretched that I could not
keep away. Miss Leicester called me out of the
room a moment or two after you went, and told
me that a London doctor was coming, and that
there was to be an operation, and that Kate's
life hung in the balance. I felt nearly wild; I
thought that I could not live if Kate died&mdash;there
had been a horrid cloud between us two, and I
had not been able to set matters right with Kate,
and I did feel that life would be unendurable if
Kate were taken away. I went into the cathedral,
and I knelt there and prayed to God. I
was in desperation, and I spoke in a desperate
way. I asked God to make Kate better, just as
if I were demanding something from him, and I
said, 'If you will do it, I will do something for
you; I will give up my life to you, if you will
only do it.' Miss Forester, I spoke in a sort of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
passion, I felt so fierce and wretched and desperate,
then I came away, and in the morning Kate
was better, and now she has recovered. But
there is my vow to God, I daren't break it, and
yet I don't know how to keep it. I promised to
give myself to him altogether. I did it, not
because I love him, but because I wanted something
from him; but now, at any cost, I must
keep my bargain. Oh, what am I to do? what
am I to do?"</p>

<p>"To live the consecrated life," said Miss
Forester slowly.</p>

<p>Molly's head had been lowered, tears were
running down her cheeks; she looked up at
these words.</p>

<p>"I don't pretend that you did right, Molly,"
said the principal; "but you did as many
another poor tempest-tossed soul has done before
you&mdash;you struggled to make a bargain with your
Maker. Well, child, he was gracious enough to
answer your request; now keep your part."</p>

<p>"That is what I want to do," said Molly; "but
can I, can I do it without love?"</p>

<p>"Don't you love your Heavenly Father, my
dear?"</p>

<p>Molly blushed.</p>

<p>"Not as I love Kate," she said; "nor Cecil;
not as I love you."</p>

<p>"Come here, my love, and hold my hand."</p>

<p>Molly went up to Miss Forester's side. Her
soft little hand was clasped in the kindly grasp
of the older woman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have lived through a great many of these
tempests," she said, bending down and looking
into Molly's flushed face. "When I was your
age, I did not love God best; but now there is
no one like him. We were made for God, Molly,
as St. Augustine said; we can't be happy apart
from him. We don't know that when we are
young, but if we use life aright, it teaches us
this great lesson. You have made a vow, dear,
and you must keep it."</p>

<p>"But ought I to go as a missionary or anything
of that sort?" asked Molly.</p>

<p>Miss Forester could scarcely help smiling.</p>

<p>"Missionaries are not the only people who
keep a vow of consecration," she said.</p>

<p>"But doesn't it mean that I ought to do something
very special?"</p>

<p>"It means," said Miss Forester suddenly,
"that you ought to do your school work, and
your home work when it comes, from quite a
different standpoint from that which influences
the girl whose life is not consecrated. You must
set God in the middle of your life, and do everything
from his point of view. You say you
don't love him much now, but love will come
very quickly. It is surprising how soon the vain
and silly things of life will assume their true
proportions, how interesting all your fellow-creatures
will be, because you will try to look at
them from the point of view from which God
regards them. You must make a friend of your
Father in heaven; where Christ would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
denied himself, you must do the same. My
love, it is not an easy life, but it is a very grand
one. It need not, in any sense of the word, prevent
your enjoying the innocent pleasures of the
world; you may be the kindest of friends, the
most loving of daughters, the most diligent of
pupils, all the more, not the less, because you
lead a consecrated life."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Molly, in a low tone. She
soon afterward took her leave.</p>

<p>As she walked back to St. Dorothy's she
thought with a feeling of almost rapture of
all that Miss Forester had said to her; her
spirit was so uplifted that she thought no
temptation too strong not to be easily overcome.</p>

<p>"And I can be happy as well as good,"
thought the young girl, as she skipped lightly
over the ground. "What a delightful Christmas
we are all going to have! how beautiful the
world is! Oh, yes! God is very good, and I
ought to love him; I do love him. I wonder
if ever a time will come when I shall feel that I
love him best of all."</p>

<p>"Hullo! I say, Molly Lavender, won't you
stop for a minute?"</p>

<p>The voice was Matilda's, who came hurrying
and panting across the quadrangle.</p>

<p>"I saw you ahead of me, and I rushed on,"
she said. "I want to speak to you very badly;
I wonder if you will do something for me. You
have professed to be friendly to me since I came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
to St. Dorothy's; well, now is the time for you
to prove your own words."</p>

<p>"I will do what I can for you, of course,
Matty," said Molly, in her pleasantest voice.
"Now, what is the matter?"</p>

<p>"Matter enough," pouted Matilda; "you
don't know what a day I've had! All my
Christmas is completely ruined! You can just
make it bearable for me, if you like."</p>

<p>"What can I do?" said Molly, but somehow
or other the pleasure had gone out of her voice;
she had a certain premonition of what was
coming.</p>

<p>"I will tell you," said Matilda, slipping her
hand through Molly's arm, and swinging along,
in her usual ungainly gait, by her slight, young
companion's side. "I have just had a letter
from mother, and my cousin Bob, who lives
with us&mdash;bother him!&mdash;has gone and taken
scarlet fever, and of course he is at home, and
of course I can't go back for Christmas, and of
course mother wants me to stay at Redgarth,
but I won't; so there!"</p>

<p>"Oh, I am really sorry for you!" said Molly.
"But what is to be done?"</p>

<p>"Why, this," said Matilda eagerly; "I
heard Cecil and Kate talking over that delightful
scheme of yours for the seaside, and I want
to join you. I know perfectly well that neither
Kate nor Cecil can bear me, but you profess to
be my friend, and you can manage it for me,
Molly. Now, will you say 'yes,' Molly? Say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
you will be my friend; say you will manage it
for me."</p>

<p>"I really can't!" said Molly, in a cross voice.
"It is quite impossible."</p>

<p>"There, I knew you were a humbug like the
rest of them," said Matilda, removing her hand
with such violence from Molly's arm that she
almost pushed her down. "I know you got up
early last Sunday to go to the communion, but
you are like the rest of those stupid folks who
profess so much; when it comes to the point
you'll do nothing."</p>

<p>"But, but," said Molly, "it is grandmother's
party, and she said nothing about you. I can't
do it, Matilda&mdash;I really can't!"</p>

<p>"You know perfectly well it is your party,
and that the old lady will do as you please.
Anyhow, you can write and ask her if I may
come; you can say I am a plain, good sort of
girl&mdash;I shan't mind if you run down my appearance
a bit. If you just add I am a chum of
yours, she'll agree fast enough, and of course
mother will manage my expenses. If you
don't do it, Molly, I shall go to the Kings' at
Brighton, I vow and declare I will! I won't stay
here. Mother was in a way when she wrote,
and she never thought of the Kings, but I'll
remind her of them. You wouldn't much like
to be in <i>that</i> house if you knew what it was like&mdash;card
parties on Sunday, and no end of fun;
and as to the flirtations, why, Arabella has had
six proposals already, and she's not nineteen!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
I don't really care for the Kings, they are such
a fast lot; but I'll go to them rather than stay
here. If I were with you, Molly, perhaps I
might be even a little bit <i>good</i>, or perhaps I
might try to be good. Well, it is for you to
decide."</p>

<p>The girls were passing the cathedral at that
moment; the voices of the choir came out on the
evening air.</p>

<p>Molly thought, with a sort of shock, of her
vow. She was just having a pretty sharp encounter
with the enemy. Was she to fall so
quickly and so soon? She turned abruptly, and
looked full at her companion.</p>

<p>"To tell you the truth, Matilda," she said,
"I'd rather not have you."</p>

<p>"Well, that's pretty frank, upon my word!"
said Matilda; "and why?"</p>

<p>"Because," said Molly, "you don't care for
Cecil and Kate, and because I do; because Cecil,
Kate, and I are harmonious in every sense of the
word. You have not our tastes, you have not
our ideas, your plans for yourself in life are not
a bit the same as ours; but rather than&mdash;rather
than you should be wretched and perhaps do
yourself harm, Matty, I&mdash;I will talk to the girls
about it. There, don't say anything more. I
will let you know to-morrow."</p>

<p>Molly dashed away as she spoke, rushed into
the cool hall at St. Dorothy's, ran upstairs, and
locked herself into her own little room; there she
fell on her knees and wept bitterly.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX.<br />

<small>CECIL.</small></h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-a.jpg" width="59" height="60" alt="A" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi3">AT six o'clock Cecil found herself shown
into Miss Forester's presence. Miss
Forester was sitting just as Molly had
left her: she had been thinking of
Molly a good deal, and with considerable
pleasure.</div>

<p>"Molly Lavender is just the sort of girl who
will make a splendid woman by and by," thought
the principal. "She is not especially clever, but
she is capable and lovable; she is just the sort of
womanly girl who will help on the cause of the
new woman in the most effective way; she will
take up all the best of the movement, and leave
the bad alone. Dear child, I hope she will have
courage to keep her vow; it was like her to make
it in that moment of passion and despair. What
a queer, fascinating creature Kate O'Connor is!
What a strong influence she has on the other
girls! She is evidently meant to be a leader.
Ah, here comes my genius: now then for a serious
talk with her; whoever loses her chances
here, she must not."</p>

<p>"Sit down by me, Cecil; I am very pleased to
see you," said Miss Forester. "Have you had
tea?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, thank you, Miss Forester."</p>

<p>"Well, my dear, I want to talk to you about a
great many matters, and first of all, with regard
to your studies. You have not been with us a
whole term yet, and it is early days to predict
anything for you, Cecil; still, the reports from
your different mistresses are highly satisfactory
I trust you will work very hard next term. You
are advanced in every way, and there is nothing
whatever to prevent your trying for the governor's
scholarship next June."</p>

<p>"It is a very stiff examination, is it not?"
asked Cecil.</p>

<p>"Yes; but not for a girl of your abilities. I
have heard a little of your story. It is very
important for you to get on, and quickly, is it
not?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Miss Forester. I have four brothers, all
younger than myself. My eldest brother,
Maurice, is very clever, very brilliant&mdash;a splendid
fellow. Whatever happens, he must go to one
of the universities."</p>

<p>"I should recommend you to try and get him
into a good school, where he can work for a valuable
scholarship," said Miss Forester.</p>

<p>"There are several scholarships connected
with Hazlewick Grammar School," said Cecil.
"Maurice intends to try for one when he is a
little older; he could not do it before."</p>

<p>"But, my dear, four brothers to support and
start in life means a very heavy burden for such
slight shoulders as yours to carry."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<p>"We are not quite without money," said
Cecil, blushing as she spoke. "We have a hundred
and fifty pounds a year between us, and
perhaps you know, Miss Forester, that dear old
Mrs. Lavender, Molly's grandmother, is giving
me my education here free."</p>

<p>"That is a very sensible way for such a rich
woman to spend her money," said Miss Forester.
"Well, Cecil, a hundred and fifty yearly is not a
large income on which to feed, educate, and start
in the world four stalwart young sons of Britain."</p>

<p>"No; and that is the reason why I want to earn
money before Maurice is eighteen."</p>

<p>"How old is he now?"</p>

<p>"Just fourteen."</p>

<p>"Then you have four years before you," said
Miss Forester. "By the time Maurice is eighteen
you ought to be earning something. But have
you any special wish with regard to yourself?"</p>

<p>"I should like best to be what I am afraid I
cannot&mdash;a doctor."</p>

<p>"You will not earn money in that profession
for some time, Cecil."</p>

<p>"No; I quite understand that it cannot be,"
said Cecil, with a sigh.</p>

<p>"And you love it better than anything else?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I have always wished for it, since I was
quite a small child. When mother died, however,
I tried to put the thought away from me.
I should like to try to get a post in a high
school where I was offered a good salary&mdash;at any
rate until the boys are started in life."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<p>"You ought to do well as a classical mistress;
I know at first-class high schools the classical
mistress is given a very high salary. Your
knowledge of Greek and Latin is quite surprising
for so young a girl. My dear, I truly sympathize
with you in the burden you have got to
carry, and in the sacrifice you make when you
resign what you feel yourself most fitted for.
At present I do not know how you could become
a doctor and also help your brothers, but you
may be quite certain I will bear your wishes in
mind. Work with all your heart and soul next
term, Cecil; try for the scholarship, and there is
no saying what there may be before you. And
now to revert to another matter!"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes! to Kate," said Cecil suddenly.</p>

<p>"Kate has had a very narrow escape," said
Miss Forester. "When Sir John Williamson
came down to see her six weeks ago, he only
performed that critical operation as a <i>dernier
ressort</i>. It turned out successful, but she will
not be strong enough for real hard work for
some time; she is a very brilliant and gifted
creature, but she has not got your stamina and
working powers; her brain is of the imaginative
and creative order. Such brains are delicate,
and the nervous systems of persons so endowed
are very easily put out of order. Kate ought to
take a year's rest, and then come back to us. I
don't know well how to propose that, however,
because&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Because of what?" asked Cecil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>"Because something has happened. Poor
Kate's little money has all been swallowed up
by one of those rascally lawyers."</p>

<p>Miss Forester said the last words with such
sudden vehemence that Cecil could not help
laughing.</p>

<p>"The man went bankrupt," she said abruptly.
"He had invested poor Kate's money in some
scheme of his own, and at the present moment
the poor child has not got sixpence."</p>

<p>"Does she know it?" asked Cecil.</p>

<p>"No; and I don't mean her to know it until
after the holidays. Have you heard anything
about it, Cecil?"</p>

<p>"Yes, from Alice Wright; the lawyer who
went bankrupt is a cousin of Kate's. She told
me a week ago, but she said she would not
breathe it to anyone else."</p>

<p>"I hope she will not; I should be sorry if it
got to Kate's ears until she is stronger. She is
going to stay here during Christmas. I fear,
poor child! she will have a dull time, as I shall
be away, and most of the other teachers."</p>

<p>"Oh, I think I may tell you," said Cecil,
"that Kate will not have a dull time. Dear
Mrs. Lavender has proposed a lovely scheme."</p>

<p>Here Cecil explained in a few words Molly's
plan for taking her schoolfellows and Cecil's
brothers with her to the seaside.</p>

<p>"Nothing could be more delightful," said
Miss Forester, her eyes sparkling; "such a
change may set Kate up completely. When the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
holidays are over I must speak to her. I can
partly help her expenses here by means of a
fund which enables me to help girls who can't
get through the school without such assistance,
but I cannot meet all her expenses, and what is
to be done at the present moment I am unable to
say. I beg of you, Cecil, to ask Molly to be
very careful to keep all knowledge of this
calamity from Kate's ears for the present. It
was arranged, when she came here, that all
moneys was to be paid direct to me, and when
she goes away with you, I will give her a little
sum to put in her pocket. The truth, therefore,
need not leak out until she is stronger. She is a
proud girl, with a good deal of spirit. I don't
think anything would induce her to accept what
she would call charity."</p>

<p>"I wish, Miss Forester, you had heard her
when she spoke of her old life," said Cecil.
"Oh, she is not proud in the wrong way! It
was splendid the way she owned up to having
been born to poverty and a humble life, and how
beautiful she made the thing seem&mdash;like a poem."</p>

<p>"Miss Leicester told me about it," said Miss
Forester. "Poor Kate herself has just the
nature that may be called upon to suffer much
in life; but she is full of gifts, and the mere fact
of her not having money need not discourage one
so beautiful, lovable, and talented."</p>

<p>"Of course it need not," said Cecil, rising as
she spoke. "Surely Kate has enough given her
to enable her to conquer fate."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p>"She has, my love, she has. But just at
present, she is weak, and might not rise above a
blow of this sort. Keep the knowledge from her,
Cecil, until she returns; then we will have a
grand conference. If only I can conquer that
obstinate pride of hers, I know one or two
wealthy women here who would, I am sure, subscribe
enough money to finish her education;
but I should not wish to do that without her
knowledge. Now, Cecil, I see you wish to go.
We break up on Monday; I shall not see you
alone again. God bless you, my love! Remember,
I look to girls like you and Molly Lavender
and Kate to uphold the honor of this great house
of learning, and to show the nation what English
girls can achieve."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX.<br />

<small>A HARD FIGHT.</small></h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-w.jpg" width="59" height="59" alt="W" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi5">WHEN Molly told Cecil and Kate of
Matilda's wish to accompany them to
their seaside retreat, she had to encounter
a storm, the intensity and bitterness
of which rather surprised her. Kate, who had
been somewhat apathetic, roused herself for this
occasion, and showed much of her former spirit.</div>

<p>"Of course, we cannot say a word," she said;
"we are your guests, Molly, and you must ask
whom you please; but I can only regard this
suggestion as an awful blow."</p>

<p>"It cannot be done," said Cecil, in her decided
voice; "it cannot be thought of, even for a
moment. Why, Molly, surely you don't wish
it; your tastes are not so completely demoralized
that you care for the society of a girl like
Matilda?"</p>

<p>"I don't care for her society," said Molly,
speaking with unexpected passion; "you don't
know how I hate and detest her, but oh, Cecil
and Kate, if you would only help me instead of
hindering me! I want to do right."</p>

<p>"Hear her!" said Kate, with a little laugh.
"Why, Molly, you always do right; what in
the world are you turning so goody-goody for?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>"Once you thought I did not do right," said
Molly, looking steadily at Kate.</p>

<p>Kate's splendid dark eyes were lowered under
Molly's direct gaze.</p>

<p>"Now, I want to do right, because&mdash;&mdash; Oh, I
can't tell you the reason, but I think Miss
Forester understands. You don't suppose I wish
to have Matilda with us, but it seems wrong&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, it seems wrong," suddenly interrupted
Cecil; "it seems extremely wrong to
make four boys and two girls utterly and completely
miserable for the sake of a low sort of
girl like Matilda."</p>

<p>"But you needn't be!" said Molly. "If nice
people shun Matilda, how is she to get nice?"</p>

<p>"She never will, my dear; rest assured of
that," said Kate. "Oh, give it up, Molly! tell
Matilda that you did your best for her, but that
we simply would not consent."</p>

<p>"But I want you to consent," said Molly.</p>

<p>"What a persistent child you are! now you
most explain yourself fully. Why should we
be sacrificed to Matilda?"</p>

<p>"You won't be sacrificed if you make her
better; you don't suppose she is going to influence
any of us to do wrong?"</p>

<p>"Oh, that is too silly an idea!"</p>

<p>"If we don't take her with us, and if afterward
we hear that she has been with people who
have helped her to get a little lower, and a little
meaner, a little more despicable than she is now&mdash;well,
we'll be sorry."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>

<p>"I declare I don't think I shall!" said Kate.
"I have such a contempt for that young person
that I don't believe anything will reform her.
She is made like that, you see; she is made small
both in mind and body. You know that new
theory about men's and women's brains: they
say that the average woman's brain weighs forty-two
ounces, and the average man's forty-eight,
but, of course, there are exceptions on both sides
of the scale. I should say that Matilda's brain
weighed about half that of the ordinary intelligent
woman."</p>

<p>"You are begging the question when you talk
like that," said Molly. "I hate her coming, but
I want her to come. I won't have her if you and
Cecil steadily set your faces against it; but if
you would let her come, I am sure it would be
happiest for us in the end."</p>

<p>"If you speak like that," said Cecil, "of
course she must come. It is your party, and we
are your guests, and what you wish must be
done. It seemed all too perfect yesterday, so
I suppose Matilda is to be the little fret and the
little cloud&mdash;the thorn in the rose, and the
rumple under the sheet. But there, don't look
so miserable, Molly; we'd put up with more
than this for your sake. Wouldn't we, Kate?"</p>

<p>"Yes; that we would," said Kate. "But
now, do listen to me, girls. I believe that
I have known Matilda Matthews longer than
either of you. I have been longer at St.
Dorothy's. I have heard all about her; I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
wouldn't mind a bit if Matilda were rough and
quarrelsome and coarse; but what I do loathe
are her underhand ways. She's not square;
she's not straight; you can never manage a
person of that sort. Now, if she's to come, do
let us make a bargain with her beforehand."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm sure she'll consent to anything!"
said Molly. "Shall I run and fetch her now?"</p>

<p>"Yes, do; we may as well get the thing
settled out of hand."</p>

<p>Molly ran quickly out of the room, returning
in a few minutes with Matilda in her train.</p>

<p>"They consent," she said, as she hurried her
companion down the corridor; "but you will
have to do what we wish, and you've got to hear
about it now."</p>

<p>"I'll do anything," said Matilda, in a humble
tone. "I'm heartily glad; I'm awfully obliged.
When the alternative is staying in this house
with the cook and housemaid, you can imagine
that I shall be easily molded, even into the
goody-goody shape. Fancy me turned goody-goody!
Fancy me cultivating all the virtues!
But I'll do it while I'm at the seaside. You
won't know me; I'll be such a model that you'll
all begin to copy me."</p>

<p>"Oh, do stop chattering!" said Molly.
"Here we are. Now, girls," she continued, as
she ushered her companion into the room, "here's
Matilda, and I think she'll do what you wish."</p>

<p>"It is very inconsiderate of you to force yourself
upon us," said Kate; "but as you are determined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
to come, and as Molly is more of an
angel than a human being, Cecil and I see nothing
for it but to submit; but we only do it on
certain conditions."</p>

<p>"It is very kind of you to have me," said
Matilda. "I am quite willing to agree to conditions.
What are they?"</p>

<p>"The principal one is this," said Kate, giving
a quick glance at Cecil as she spoke, "that you
don't <i>eavesdrop</i>."</p>

<p>Matilda's ugly face glowed under these words
to a dull crimson, her little eyes flashed an angry
fire, her lips twitched. She tried to return Kate's
glance with a look of equal scorn, but, failing
utterly, looked down, and twirled the frill of a
pretty silk apron which she was wearing.</p>

<p>"I don't think you will eavesdrop," continued
Kate, "for the simple reason that we shan't
allow it."</p>

<p>"Besides, we have a detective in the service,"
continued Cecil, in a calm voice. "My brother
Jimmy is a detective. You can never get over
Jimmy; so don't you begin to try."</p>

<p>"Perhaps, under the circumstances, you'd
rather not come," resumed Kate, in her mocking
tone. "You see, you have forced yourself
into the company of by no means congenial
spirits: it is not too late to back out of it.
You've only to say the word, and we shall be&mdash;I'm
sure I speak for us all&mdash;<i>so</i> grateful to you."</p>

<p>"I think you are rather hard," said Molly,
who quite pitied Matilda's look of confusion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, what will you do?" continued Kate.</p>

<p>Matilda looked up at these words. If ever
there was a look of concentrated hate on any
face, it shone now on hers, as she returned Kate's
glance.</p>

<p>"I will come," she said, in a low voice; under
her breath she added, "If for no other reason
than to spite you."</p>

<p>"Very well," said Cecil; "you promise to
conform to the first condition?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes."</p>

<p>"Oh, please say no more about that," interrupted
Molly.</p>

<p>"The second condition," said Cecil, "is also
essential to the happiness of the larger number
of our party. Independent of you, Matilda, the
party will consist of three girls and four boys;
these seven individuals having, to a certain extent,
the same tastes, the same aims in life, the
same aspirations. Now, while with us, you, who
are in the minority, are on all occasions to submit
to the vote of the majority. During this
holiday, which but for you would be perfectly
delightful, our wishes are to be carried out, <i>not</i>
yours. Do you agree to this?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes&mdash;I must!"</p>

<p>"I think that is all," said Cecil. "Isn't it,
Kate?"</p>

<p>"Yes, that is all," answered Kate; "only if
Matilda still wishes to stay at St. Dorothy's during
Christmas vacation, she can do so."</p>

<p>"No; I will go with you," said Matilda. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
turned toward the door, opened it, and went
quickly out. In the passage outside her face
changed, she clenched her hands and stamped
her feet.</p>

<p>"If I don't make Kate O'Connor eat humble
pie, if I don't punish Cecil Ross for speaking to
me as she has done, my name is not Matilda
Matthews!" she muttered. "Yes, I will go, if
only to spite them both. I will find out a way
of revenge. How dared they speak to me as
they did? Molly Lavender is well enough; she
is a weak, goody-goody little thing of no character;
I've nothing to say against her&mdash;at least
not now. But oh, Cecil, you owe me a fine arrear
of debts! And as to you, Kate, you will be sorry
some day that you pitted your strength and will
against mine. When first I thought of this plan
I meant to be pretty good, if you would let me
go; but now I won't be good; I'll only pretend
to be good. Not eavesdrop, indeed! Oh, won't
I, though, if necessary!"</p>

<p>Matilda hurried back to her room to write
to her mother. Cecil and Kate looked at
Molly.</p>

<p>"Well, are you happy now, Molly Lavender?"
asked Kate.</p>

<p>"I think I am," replied Molly. "I think
Matilda will try not to make herself too obnoxious."</p>

<p>"She'll be the snake in the grass, but we're in
for her now," said Kate. "Don't let us waste
any more time over her at present. Where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
shall we go? That is the next point to be considered."</p>

<p>The girls then drew their chairs to the little
table in Molly's room, and, with a map of England
and a gazetteer before them, began to plan
out their holiday.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI.<br />

<small>GIRLS AND BOYS.</small></h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-b.jpg" width="60" height="60" alt="B" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi2">BREAKING-UP day came quickly round,
and a merry party assembled at the
railway station to go off to a small
watering-place which went by the name
of St. Jude's, and was within three miles of
Whitby. Even Matilda was on her best behavior.
To her relief, she discovered that Kate and Cecil
meant to treat her with an easy sort of good-nature
until, as they expressed it, she broke her
compact.</div>

<p>"When you do that, we will boycott you,"
said Kate, in her frank way; "as long as you
keep it, we will do nothing to make you miserable.
Now, come along and take your seat in
the carriage."</p>

<p>"But surely we are not going to travel third
class?" began Matilda.</p>

<p>"Yes, we are," answered Kate; "because the
majority of us prefer to save our money. Now,
hop in. No, you are not to take the corner, that
is Molly's seat; don't you see her umbrella
there?"</p>

<p>Molly would have given up her coveted corner
to Matilda, but a glance from Kate prevented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
this. The four girls found themselves rather
crowded, and Matilda, under different circumstances,
would have shown a good deal of selfishness
and ill-nature; but the infection of three
perfectly happy people was too much for her,
and she found herself joining in the mirth, and
even adding her quota to the jokes, before the
journey had come to an end. Late in the evening
the girls arrived at Whitby, where they were
met not only by the boys, but by a large, roomy
wagonette, into which they all tumbled helter-skelter.
The luggage was crowded up on the
driver's seat, and squeezed into every imaginable
corner, and soon the happy party started on
their way. It wanted but three days to Christmas;
the moon was at the full, the stars shone
brightly, there was a keen frosty feel in the air.
It was impossible on such an occasion to be anything
but merry and cheerful; the boys cracked
jokes; Maurice sat close to Cecil with his arm
round her waist; Jimmy made himself comfortable
by leaning against Molly, and finally dropping
his curly head on her shoulder; and Charlie
and Teddy, after a little demur, began to devote
themselves to Matilda. They did not much care
for her look, but they thought it would be fun to
draw her out. Accordingly, they sat at each side
of her, and regaled her with false information
with regard to the scenery and the country
generally. The boys were keen naturalists;
Matilda had lived all her life, except when at
school, in London.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<p>"Isn't the air delicious?" said Teddy. "Rather
too warm, if anything."</p>

<p>"Why, I am perfectly shivering," answered
Matilda. "I wish you could feel my hands.
Oh, this is much worse than London!" she continued.
"Fancy driving in an open conveyance
in the month of December; my chilblains will
get much worse from this biting, frosty air."</p>

<p>"Do you suffer from chilblains?" asked
Charlie, in a sympathetic voice. "Did you ever
have one on your nose?"</p>

<p>"No," said Matilda, with a little cry. "Oh,
horrors! do people get them on their noses in
the country?"</p>

<p>"Well, I don't, because I'm acclimatized,"
said Charlie; "but one of the fellows in my form
generally gets one in the beginning of the winter;
it worries him a good bit. He used to live in
London, and he never suffered there&mdash;he says it
is the change to the country. Is your nose cold
now? If it is, I'll get out and bring in a little
snow. If you rub it hard with snow, you may
not suffer; if you don't&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, what will happen?" asked Matilda.</p>

<p>"It may be frost-bitten; that's much more
serious than chilblains. Perhaps I'd better get
the snow."</p>

<p>"Charlie, what are you talking about?"
interrupted Maurice. "Please don't mind a
word he says, Miss Matthews; it isn't a bit
colder here than in London, and people don't get
chilblains on their noses, if they take exercise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
enough. Come along, Teddy and Charlie, you
both change places with me and talk to Cecil for
a bit; she has no end of things to tell you.
I will sit near you, Miss Matthews, and point
out some of the beauties of the country."</p>

<p>The transfer was quickly made, and Matilda
found her fears soothed and her vanity agreeably
tickled by Maurice's courteous attentions. The
short drive came quickly to an end; the lodgings
were found to be perfection; a boisterous supper
ensued, after which Cecil, Kate, Molly, and the
boys ran down to the shore. Matilda, who was
very nervous on the subject of chilblains, elected
to stay at home, and Maurice, with a wistful
glance at his sister and her friends, offered to
remain with her, but Molly put a stop to that.</p>

<p>"You are the grown-up one of the party," she
said, with a smile at the handsome lad; "we
want you to protect us. I think, Matty, you will
find a book in my bag, if you like to open it."</p>

<p>"Thanks," said Matilda, "but I am so sleepy
I shall go straight to bed; I hope the servant has
put a hot bottle in my bed. I suppose there is
no objection to my ordering a fire in my room, is
there, Molly?"</p>

<p>"Oh, none whatever," replied Molly; "if Miss
Pantry does not object to the trouble."</p>

<p>"I can pay for what I require," said Matilda,
in a gruff tone.</p>

<p>She walked deliberately to the bell and rang
it. The servant, a good-natured, round-cheeked
girl, soon answered the summons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p>"Will you light a fire in my bedroom
directly?" said Matilda, "and have the goodness
to let me know when it has blazed up bright
and cheerful."</p>

<p>"Well, girls, come on if you are coming," said
Maurice.</p>

<p>The others left the house, and Matilda was alone.</p>

<p>"What in the world did you bring her for?"
said Jimmy, the moment they got outside.</p>

<p>"Now, look here, Jimmy," said Cecil, "we
are not going to begin that sort of conversation
at the very commencement of our holidays.
Matilda is here, and we must make the best of
her. But for Molly, we should none of us be
having this delightful treat; Matilda is Molly's
guest, and I expect her to be treated civilly."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't be rude to a lady for the world,"
said Teddy, drawing himself up.</p>

<p>"Nor I," burst from Charlie's lips; "only
she doesn't seem to be your sort, Molly, nor
yours, Cecil, nor yours, Miss O'Connor."</p>

<p>"Race me to the shore, Jimmy," said Kate
suddenly.</p>

<p>The moonlight covered the wide white road,
the smell of the sea came to Kate's nostrils, the
grand sound of the sea to her ears.</p>

<p>"Oh, I can almost believe myself back in Ireland
again," she said, with a sort of panting sigh.
"I must run, or the delight of it all will be too
much for me. Come along, Jimmy, I see by the
shape of your legs you are a good runner. Now,
one, two, and away."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>

<p>Kate's running was almost as swift as the
wind. Jimmy, Teddy, and Charlie eagerly
joined in the race; Molly, Cecil, and Maurice
walked behind.</p>

<p>"Oh," said Molly, "what good this will do
Kate! she is a different creature already. I do
hope Matilda will go to bed early every night.
Perhaps she will if we make her room thoroughly
comfortable."</p>

<p>"If I thought that&mdash;&mdash;" said Maurice, with a
smile.</p>

<p>"Why, what would you do, dear?" asked his
sister.</p>

<p>"I'd see to the lighting of that fire myself;
but look here, Ceci, the boys must not tease her
too much. You know Charlie and Teddy are
little imps of mischief, and Jimmy is so clever,
there's no being up to him when he is bent on
sport, as he calls it. The best and the worst of
it is, that Matilda will never see when they are
poking fun at her. Did you hear them to-night
about chilblains? I know perfectly well what
they'll do. They'll be as polite as little angels
until they find out all her weak points, and then,
woe betide her, more especially if she has a
secret fear."</p>

<p>"You must talk to them," said Cecil.
"Matilda is Molly Lavender's guest, and it will
be very shabby of us to give her a bad time."</p>

<p>"But you don't really like her, do you,
Molly?" asked Maurice.</p>

<p>"Not really," answered Molly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>

<p>"She is the thorn in the rose," said Cecil, with
a sigh. "You know we can never expect perfection
here, Maurice, old boy, and our holiday
would be too good were it not for Matilda.
Well, now, let us talk of something else; you
must have a lot to tell me. How have you got
on with Mr. Danvers? Is the poor, good-natured
man still in the land of the living?"</p>

<p>"I should rather think he is! He's the best
fellow going," said Maurice, with enthusiasm.
"I wish I could tell you half what he has done
for me, Cecil. He coaches me in Greek and
Latin every evening before he goes to bed, and I
have got on like a house on fire. I shall be in
the sixth next term. In short, I am nearly safe
to win that scholarship."</p>

<p>"You must have worked very hard, Maurice,"
said Cecil.</p>

<p>"Well, I did put on the screw a good bit, but
how could I help it when I thought of you pegging
away?"</p>

<p>"And how are the other boys doing?" asked
Cecil.</p>

<p>"Jimmy and Charlie are doing famously;
Teddy's idle. Mr. Danvers says there's no real
work in him; but then he is young yet, and you
can't expect us all to have old heads on young
shoulders, can you, Cecil?"</p>

<p>"No, no; I'm perfectly content with you as
you are," answered Cecil. "I wish I could
thank Mr. Danvers for what he has done for
you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, you will have an opportunity, for he
has actually promised to come to St. Jude's
before the new year&mdash;that is, provided you will
promise me beforehand never to invite him either
to dinner or tea. He's awfully shy of women,
and we'll have to humor him with regard to all
his little pet weaknesses."</p>

<p>"But I want really to get to know him," said
Cecil.</p>

<p>"Well, perhaps you will if you are careful.
You must just make his acquaintance without
seeming to make it. If once he caught sight of a
girl like Matilda, he would fly the place&mdash;I know
he would. Now, that Irish girl, Kate&mdash;what do
you call her?"</p>

<p>"Kate O'Connor."</p>

<p>"Kate O'Connor, well, she'd be just his sort;
he'd compare her to one of his Greek heroines,
Iphigenia or Persephone. He doesn't mind
thinking of women, and even talking of them, if
he can compare them to Greeks, but the modern
English sort! oh, we will try to keep him from
talking about them. He once saw you, Cecil;
he said you had the patient sort of look which
Penelope used to wear&mdash;that was his sole remark
about you; he shut up his lips then, and rumpled
his hair, and went to the stove to cook some
bacon. By the way, he's the best cook I ever
came across in all my life. I wish you could
taste his toffee."</p>

<p>"Toffee!" cried Cecil. "Can Mr. Danvers
stoop to toffee?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, can't he? We were doing it up in the
back bedroom. He caught us over it one night
with a saucepan with a hole in the bottom&mdash;the
smell was awful; the stuff was going through on
to the fire. His whole face got scarlet; he rushed
downstairs, and brought up a china-lined saucepan
of his own. Teddy had to fly for half a
pound of butter, a pound of moist sugar, and a
quarter of a pound of almonds. He stood over
that toffee until it was cooked to perfection, and
then he poured it out on to a large tin, and the
next day, when it was cold, he cut it up and gave
it to us. He was more excited than any of us
over it."</p>

<p>"I tell you what it is," said Molly; "Mr.
Danvers shall make toffee for us&mdash;yes, for us&mdash;when
he comes to St. Jude's; we'll manage it
somehow."</p>

<p>"You must look like a Greek goddess, or he
won't," said Maurice; "and I am not sure that
you are quite the style."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, she is," said Cecil, with a laugh;
"she'd make a lovely little Alcestis."</p>

<p>"No, I shouldn't," answered Molly, with a
laugh. "I am much&mdash;much too modern; I'll
allow you, Cecil, and Kate, to do the Greek
heroines to perfection, but I shall stick to just
being a modern English girl. Who knows but
that I may conquer Mr. Danvers' prejudices, and
get him to drop his dislike to the English girl of
the latter half of the century."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII.<br />

<small>MATILDA'S OPPORTUNITY.</small></h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-t.jpg" width="59" height="58" alt="T" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi2">THE first week in the country passed off
without flaw or disturbance of any
kind. Matilda was true to her promise;
no one could catch her even attempting
to eavesdrop; she interfered with none of the
arrangements of the others, but plodded along,
not adding her quota of merriment or joy, but
still behaving much better than anyone expected.</div>

<p>"It is too good to last," thought Kate, who
knew her well.</p>

<p>But Cecil and Molly began to believe that they
had been overhard on Matilda. As the days
wore on they tried to draw her out. They were
intensely happy themselves, and they wanted all
their companions to share their pleasure. Christmas
had passed delightfully, and New Year's
day drew on, arrived, and sank into the annals
of the past. A day or two after the new year,
Maurice was much delighted to receive a letter
from Mr. Danvers, to tell him that he had taken
rooms in the next terrace to theirs, and might be
expected to arrive that evening.</p>

<p>"I do not wish you to pay any attention to
this letter," said the schoolmaster. "I am simply
coming to St. Jude's because I have heard of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
famous air of the place, and I really want to get
braced up a little. Do not on any account acquaint
the ladies of your party of my intended
arrival. You can drop in to see me if you like
some evening, and if we should happen to meet
in any of our walks, I shall, of course, be pleased
to see you. I hope the other lads are well. By
the way, you might coach Teddy up a little in his
Latin; we ought to get him into Cæsar next
term; do your best, Maurice.</p>

<div class='sig'>
<span style="margin-right: 3em;">"Your sincere friend,</span><br />
"<span class="smcap">John Danvers</span>."<br />
</div>

<p>"Who is your letter from, Maurice?" asked
Molly.</p>

<p>"He said I wasn't to tell you anything about
it," said Maurice, looking up with sparkling
eyes.</p>

<p>"Oh, we know what that means," said Cecil.
"Mr. Danvers is coming at last&mdash;how glad I
am!"</p>

<p>"You really must not force yourself on him,"
said Maurice, a pucker coming between his
brows; "he honestly hates all women, and poor
old chap, his prejudices must be humored. He
didn't wish me to let you know that he was
coming. I may drop in on him some day, if I
fancy."</p>

<p>"I say!" exclaimed Teddy; "much chance he
has of getting rid of us in that style."</p>

<p>"He wants you to attack your Cæsar," said
Maurice, fixing his eyes on his brother.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, perhaps, after all, we'd better not bother
him too much," was the quick reply. "I say,
Charlie and Jimmy, let's run off for a scamper;
it's a splendid day. How the wind does blow!"</p>

<p>"It's snowing as fast as ever it can," said
Matilda, shivering as she spoke. "If you call
this a splendid day, I must say I don't admire
your taste; for my part, I am going to sit over
the fire. Mother sent me down a copy of 'The
Golden Butterfly' this morning; it looks interesting,
and I shall spend my time reading it."</p>

<p>"It is not a bit too cold for a walk," said
Cecil. "Who will come with me?"</p>

<p>"I, for one," cried Molly. "Are you coming,
Kate?"</p>

<p>"No," answered Kate; "my head aches."</p>

<p>When she said this, Matilda raised her eyes
and gave her a quick and furtive glance, which
nobody noticed. Molly and Cecil ran off to put
on their warmest wraps, and were presently seen
battling with the wind, and going off in the direction
of the sea. The four boys had all disappeared,
and Kate and Matilda found themselves
alone in the snug little parlor. Matilda piled coal
on the fire until it blazed and crackled merrily;
she then drew forward the only really comfortable
chair, seated herself in it, put her feet on the
fender, rested her head against the cushions,
opened her novel, and prepared to read. Kate
collected some books, sat down by the center
table, leaned her elbows upon it, pressed one of
her hands against her cheek, and tried, with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
help of a lexicon, to translate, as best she could, a
somewhat difficult passage of Homer. She soon
became absorbed in her task; her brow cleared,
her eyes grew full of light, her lips moved softly
as the beautiful meaning of the grand old text
began to unfold itself before her. Matilda, who
was no reader, who was incapable of even thoroughly
enjoying a novel, uttered a profound
yawn, slightly turned her head, and looked at
Kate.</p>

<p>"What in the world are you doing?" she said,
in an abrupt voice.</p>

<p>"Don't speak to me for a minute," said Kate.</p>

<p>"I do believe you are studying, and that is forbidden!"
cried Matilda.</p>

<p>"I wish you would stop talking," cried Kate.
She turned the pages of her lexicon quickly,
found the word she required, shut up her Homer,
and looked at Matilda with flushed cheeks and
sparkling eyes.</p>

<p>"Now you'll have a headache. How awfully
silly you are!" said Matilda. "And you
are breaking the rules, too; it was arranged that
none of us were to study."</p>

<p>"I am doing nothing underhand," said Kate.
"I have been feeling much better, and we
agreed that a very little study in the morning
could not hurt me."</p>

<p>"For my part," said Matilda, "I wonder you
do not grasp the opportunity of having a real
rest. If you knew how <i>I</i> detest work?"</p>

<p>"You see, I love it," said Kate. "Perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
you will allow me to go on with it now. Is not
your book interesting?"</p>

<p>"Pretty well; it's about a girl who didn't
know anything at all; but all the same she
seemed to have an uncommonly jolly time of it.
I can't make out what is the use of grinding:
it spoils your eyes, and your figure, and your
temper, and men don't think a bit the more of
you for it. After all, women are sent into the
world just to please the men."</p>

<p>"I should like to ask you a question," said
Kate. "Why, with your views, did you trouble
to come to Redgarth?"</p>

<p>"Simply and entirely," replied Matilda,
"because it is the fashion just at present for
girls to be educated. Mother took it into her
head that I must be in the fashion. I am just
going to scrape through somehow, just to please
mother. I do hope she will let me leave at the
end of the summer term."</p>

<p>"I sincerely hope so, too," answered Kate.</p>

<p>"Why do you say that?"</p>

<p>"Because girls like you are a disgrace to
a place like Redgarth."</p>

<p>"Don't you think you are very rude?" said
Matilda, flushing deeply.</p>

<p>"I am sorry if I am, but you force me to
speak plainly, now and then. Will you stop
talking now and let me return to my Homer."</p>

<p>"Yes, I will, after I have said something.
I am truly sorry for you, although you are
spiteful and unkind to me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't need your sympathy, thanks,"
answered Kate.</p>

<p>"All the same, you can't help my giving it to
you. I am sorry for you, because it is important
for you to work, and I fear, after that bad
accident, you won't be fit for much for some
time. I had a cousin who fell on her head when
she was a girl; she was never any good afterward&mdash;she
developed epileptic fits. Her brain
was badly injured, but not so badly as yours.
Now, I won't say any more, but if I were you,
I wouldn't work at that dull old Homer longer
than I could help. I am giving you a piece of
sensible advice; you can take it or not, as you
please."</p>

<p>Kate did not utter a word. Matilda sighed,
fidgeted, and resumed her novel. She was feeling
deeply annoyed. If Kate had flown into a
passion, or show any disturbance at her taunting
words, she would have felt that she had had
her revenge; but Kate was calmness itself; she
was once more deep in her books; the poetry of
the king of poets was enchanting her: her noble
brow looked full of intellect, her lovely eyes
were sparkling, her lips were like roses.</p>

<p>"Yes, she's clever," thought Matilda as she
watched her. "I don't suppose her brain is
much injured&mdash;I doubt if it is injured at all.
And she's beautiful, too; there's no sort of sense
in denying it. How I wish she were ugly, and&mdash;yes,
and stupid! but she's not&mdash;she's graceful,
too; she never does an ungraceful thing. How<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
I detest her! how I hate her! What right has
a girl of that sort to be at St. Dorothy's?
Why, she's nothing whatever but a peasant girl&mdash;an
Irish peasant girl; but, of course, no one
cares for that, just because she happens to have
a good-looking face. Oh, dear! I can't stand
any more of this stupid novel. I wonder if it is
too cold to go out; it isn't snowing at present,
the sun is shining. I think I'll go for a run."</p>

<p>Matilda rose to her feet; she yawned and
stretched herself as she did so.</p>

<p>"Hadn't you better come out?" she said,
fixing her eyes on the student.</p>

<p>"No, thanks!"</p>

<p>"I am going."</p>

<p>"Very well."</p>

<p>"You are sure you would not like to come
with me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, quite sure; do you mind shutting the
door when you leave the room?"</p>

<p>Matilda had just approached the door, when it
was suddenly opened by the rosy-cheeked maid-servant,
and a little man with red hair, and
spectacles pushed up on his forehead, was
ushered into the room.</p>

<p>"I think Mr. Maurice is out, sir, but I will go
and look for him," said the maid.</p>

<p>Mr. Danvers&mdash;for of course it was he&mdash;found
himself almost in the arms of Matilda. Matilda
backed: she did not admire the little man with
his red head and somewhat startled eyes.</p>

<p>"Oh, horrors!" she said, under her breath.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," said Mr. Danvers. "I
called to see Maurice Ross; I traveled last night
instead of waiting until this morning. I wanted
to leave Maurice my address. Will you have
the goodness to give it to him? I"&mdash;he backed
rapidly until he nearly reached the door&mdash;"I&mdash;I
will call another time."</p>

<p>"No, indeed, you must not do anything of the
kind," said Kate, rising suddenly.</p>

<p>She came a step or two forward as she spoke;
she held her copy of Homer in one hand. The
book was somewhat heavy; as Kate pushed a
chair forward it slipped and fell.</p>

<p>"Excuse me," said Mr. Danvers, "but that
is not the way to treat a valuable book."</p>

<p>He stooped, placed it on the table, then looked
full at Kate.</p>

<p>"You don't mean to say you are reading
Greek?" he said.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed I am," answered Kate; "and I
have just come to a most difficult passage; I am
making an awful mess of it. Maurice tells me
that you are devoted to the classics; perhaps,
while you are waiting, you will construe this
passage for me."</p>

<p>"With pleasure; show me your translation."</p>

<p>"Oh, it is too poor for you to look at!"</p>

<p>"Show it to me; I can soon tell you if you
have gone wrong."</p>

<p>Kate held up her exercise book.</p>

<p>"Take a chair, won't you?" she said.</p>

<p>Without a word Mr. Danvers dropped into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
one she had been using. He absolutely forgot
that she was a girl; he began to read her translation,
pursing up his lips as he did so.</p>

<p>"Good, so far," he said. "Oh, here is a
wrong quantity; disgraceful, careless! Aren't
you ashamed of yourself to do work of this sort?
What will the boys of England come to?"</p>

<p>"But you are scolding a girl of Ireland," said
Kate, in a gentle tone.</p>

<p>Mr. Danvers glanced up at her.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, miss," he said; "really,
women ought not to meddle in matters too deep
for them."</p>

<p>"But you will be good-natured and help me,
won't you? You may as well do that as nothing,
while you are waiting for Maurice; I felt sure I
had gone wrong in that line. Will you show
me? I shall be so grateful."</p>

<p>"Well, I can't see Homer murdered," exclaimed
Mr. Danvers; "so here goes."</p>

<p>"Matilda," said Kate, facing round and looking
at Matilda, who was standing in some perplexity
near the door, "you are going out, are
you not?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Matilda.</p>

<p>"If you see Maurice, will you kindly tell him
that Mr. Danvers has come?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Matilda again. She left the
room, shutting the door behind her.</p>

<p>"What an awkward, hideous little oddity!"
she said to herself. "If people grow like that
from the study of Greek, preserve me from wearing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
myself out with it. What a flirt Kate
O'Connor is! pretending she wants to be helped
with her stupid, musty old Homer! she just
dropped the book on purpose. Well, I wish her
joy of her prize in that old scarecrow. Yes, I
may as well go out. I could not read 'The Golden
Butterfly' in the same room with that parchment
creature. To see Kate pretending to be so
eager, and that old man falling into the trap so
easily, is too much for my nerves. Perhaps he
would not if he knew that she was only a peasant
girl; perhaps he will know it some day.
Now then, to find Maurice, and put a stop to
this flirtation."</p>

<p>Matilda hastily donned a handsome sealskin
jacket, and, wrapped from head to foot in the
warmest furs, sallied forth into the cold January
atmosphere. She walked as far as the shore,
but, look to right and look to left as she would,
she could not see a sign of any of her companions.
The short gleam of sunshine had long ago disappeared;
fresh banks of heavy clouds had come
up from the north, and were covering the entire
sky. Presently the snow began to fall; it fell
faster and faster, thicker and thicker; it covered
Matilda's sealskin jacket; it beat pitilessly
against her cheeks, and even got into her eyes.
She had forgotten to bring out an umbrella, and
was therefore exposed to the full fury of the
weather; she was quite a mile from home, too.
What was to be done?</p>

<p>She by no means liked her present predicament;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
physical hardship of any sort was repellent
to her. She walked on, buffeted by the
weather, and feeling herself a truly wretched
girl, when, to her relief, she saw a little shelter
which had been put up along the shore, and
which she had forgotten all about. She ran to
it, sat down inside the glass-covered inclosure,
and drew a long breath of relief. Part of this
shelter was under repair, and was covered with
scaffolding, canvas, and heavy boards. Matilda
had scarcely seated herself in the glass part of
the shelter before she heard footsteps approaching.
She also heard voices which she immediately
recognized; they were those of Maurice,
Jimmy, and the other boys.</p>

<p>Now, Matilda had not made friends with the
Ross boys. Maurice she would have tolerated
had he shown her any special attention; the
other three she cordially detested. She did not
at all wish them to find her now, covered with
snow, and looking blue, and miserable. She
knew that Jimmy would immediately speak
about her nose. Matilda's nose was a source of
anxiety to herself, for the slightest thing made
it red and swollen; the horror of a chilblain on
this prominent portion of her face had been one
of her terrors since her early childhood. Jimmy
would be sure to tell her that the first signs of a
chilblain were approaching. Scarcely considering
what she was doing, she rushed into the dark
part of the shelter, pulled forward some tarpaulin
and matting, and, crouching down behind some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
boards, was completely lost to view. She
resolved to stay in this hiding-place until the
boys had left the shelter. She had scarcely
made herself secure before they all entered.
They stood by the entrance watching the storm
and chattering hard to one another.</p>

<p>"How jolly!" said Jimmy; "we'll be able to
snowball if this snow goes on much longer. I'm
glad we are in for a downright good fall of snow.
Isn't it fine to see it scudding as it does right
across the sea? I should not be a bit surprised
if we had a wreck to-night!"</p>

<p>"Oh, I say!" exclaimed Charlie, "if that
isn't Molly and Cecil just turning the promontory;
what a long walk they have taken! Do
look at Cecil; see how her dress is blown by the
wind&mdash;oh, and Molly's umbrella is inside out.
What a mess they'll be in; why, this snow will
wet them through. What is it, Maurice? Did
you say anything?"</p>

<p>"I am going to meet them," said Maurice;
"you stay quiet, if you can, you three, and
don't be up to any larks. I'll bring the girls in
here; they'll be sure to miss this little shelter if
I don't point it out."</p>

<p>"Let me go with you," said Charlie.</p>

<p>"No, no! stay where you are; you are wet
through as it is."</p>

<p>Thrusting his hands deep into his pockets,
Maurice ran as fast as he could in the direction
from where his sister and her friend were approaching
him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span></p>

<p>Meanwhile, the three younger boys were alone
in the shelter&mdash;that is, they supposed themselves
to be alone but they little knew that Matilda,
breathing hard and feeling terrified, was within
earshot. She had scarcely concealed herself
in her little shelter before she repented of
her own rash act. Suppose by any chance
she was discovered! Those awful boys would
think as little of reconnoitering the dark part of
the shed as they would of breathing or whistling.
The three younger boys were about the most
mischievous, most restless creatures Matilda had
ever come across&mdash;they were never still for an
instant. Oh, suppose they discovered her!
Cruelly as Matilda hated both Cecil and Kate,
she also feared them. She knew that no words
of hers would prevent the rest of her companions
believing that she had hidden herself
for the purpose of eavesdropping. They would
certainly keep their word if she were discovered,
and boycott her on the spot.</p>

<p>Matilda would not have minded being boycotted
by such girls as Kate and Cecil were she
at school. But here at St. Jude's this state of
things would make her a very miserable girl
indeed; she reflected that, under such circumstances,
she might have had a better time with
the cook and housemaid at St. Dorothy's.
Well, there was no help for it now: she must
stay as mute as a mouse, and take her chance
of not being discovered.</p>

<div class="caption">A LITTLE MAN WITH RED HAIR, AND SPECTACLES PUSHED UP ON HIS FOREHEAD, WAS USHERED INTO THE ROOM.</div>
</div>

<p>Luckily for her, Jimmy, with a shout, suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
discovered a large crab, which had found
its way into the shelter. He dropped on his
knees and began eagerly to examine his captive.
Soon the three boys began to wrangle over their
prey, and Matilda breathed a gentle sigh of relief.
The noise of approaching footsteps was
again heard above the gale, and Maurice and the
two girls entered the little shelter. The entire
party now stood by the entrance watching the
snow and commenting about it. By Cecil's
request, Jimmy ran out with the poor crab, and
deposited it in the nearest pool of water; he
then returned to the shelter. They all remained
there until the heavy snow-shower had slightly
abated; then the boys decided to go to the
house to fetch Cecil's and Molly's waterproofs.
They ran off quickly, and the girls seated themselves
on the bench at the back of the shelter.</p>

<p>"You might as well read me that letter now,
Cecil," said Molly.</p>

<p>"Very well," answered Cecil; "there are
sure to be no eavesdroppers about to-day, are
there?"</p>

<p>"Scarcely, seeing that we left Matilda snugly
ensconced at home with her book."</p>

<p>"Oh, did you?" muttered that young lady,
from her hiding-place.</p>

<p>"I think it is awfully kind of Miss Forester
to write to me. Don't you, Molly?" said Cecil.</p>

<p>"Yes; but, after all, it is just the thing she
would do. She takes an immense interest in
you; she is very proud of you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span></p>

<p>"I intend to make her proud of me," said
Cecil, drawing herself up and looking straight
ahead of her. "If ever a girl has made up her
mind simply to grind, to find no obstacle too
difficult to overcome, I am that girl. Miss
Forester suggests that I should try for the great
scholarship in June. I mean to try."</p>

<p>"Well, I wish you success," said Molly;
"you are clever enough for anything. Now,
then, do read the letter; those boys will be back
in no time."</p>

<p>Cecil took it out of her pocket; she opened it,
drew a little closer to Molly, and began to read
aloud:</p>

<blockquote>

<div class='unindent'>"<span class="smcap">My Dear Cecil</span>:</div>

<p>"I wish to consult you and Molly about your friend Kate.
I know, in doing so, that you will regard every word I say
as absolutely sacred, and not breathe the contents of this
letter to any of your companions. You know that poor
dear Kate O'Connor has lost her little money; you also
know that at the present moment she is quite unaware of
the sad fact that she is practically penniless. Having
regard to her peculiar temperament, to a certain pride
which in many ways is scarcely wrong, and which she
inherits, doubtless, from her Irish ancestors, I am inclined
to believe that the wisest course to pursue would be to keep
her in ignorance of the calamity which has fallen upon
her. The other day I had the pleasure of a long interview
with a great friend of mine, a Mrs. Percival. She is very
rich, and has often given large donations toward the
expenses here. I told her Kate's story, and she suggested
the scheme which I now write to you about. It is simply
this, that Kate is not to be told that her money is gone, and
that Mrs. Percival will pay her fees here, and allow her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
sufficient money to dress properly, and also for minor
expenses. Fortunately, Kate's little money in London has
always been paid into my bank, and I can still provide her
with funds without arousing her suspicion in any way.
Hers is a very peculiar temperament; she has many of
the attributes of genius, but I doubt if she has the capacity,
or even mental power, for a sustained strain of hard work.</p>

<p>"I regard you, Cecil, and Kate O'Connor, as quite the
cleverest girls at present at St. Dorothy's; but, although
you are both undoubtedly brilliant, you are essentially different;
you have got the capacity for work. If you avail
yourself of the privileges which are now accorded to you,
you can acquire knowledge to a great extent, and use that
knowledge very brilliantly in the future. Kate, on the
other hand, has a more delicate organism; hers are more
the gifts of fancy. She is endowed with imagination of a
high order; she is intellectual without being logical. In
the future, it is possible that she may earn her bread by
writing; she may either take up fiction or some other
branch of literature. If she avails herself of the advantages
of this school, she will do her work in the
future, whatever it is, well&mdash;even brilliantly; but I do not
think she will ever be profound in argument or very deep
in thought. Be that as it may, she is sufficiently above
the common to have an assured future, if nothing happens
to wreck her prospects at the present juncture. Her accident
has weakened her, and her working-powers will not
return to their old strength for a year, or even two years.
To shock her pride and hurt her now might injure her
fatally. I am inclined, therefore, although it is contrary
to my usual rule, to act on Mrs. Percival's advice, to allow
her to assist Kate without telling Kate anything about it.
When that part of her education which can be conducted
at Redgarth is over, she will be strong enough and brave
enough to learn the truth. I will then propose to her a
scheme by which she can pay Mrs. Percival back the debt
which she will owe her. You two girls are Kate's greatest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
friends, and I honor your friendship for her and one
another sufficiently to consult you on this point. I shall
be glad to get your unreserved opinions. Write to me to
my London address, which heads this paper.</p>

<div class='sig'>
<span style="margin-right: 4em;">"Yours, with affection,</span><br />
"<span class="smcap">Janet Forester</span>."<br />
</div></blockquote>

<p>"What do you think of it?" said Cecil, when
she had finished reading.</p>

<p>"There is only one thing to think," answered
Molly. "Miss Forester's scheme must be carried
out. There can be no second opinion,
surely, on that point. All through these happy
days, when I have looked at Kate, and listened
to her merry laugh, and seen the health coming
back to her cheeks and brightness to her eyes, I
could never forget the shock which was awaiting
her. Now, that shock need never come. Oh,
what a good, splendid woman Miss Forester is!"</p>

<p>"Nearly as good as your grandmother, Molly,"
replied Cecil.</p>

<p>"I meant to apply to grannie as a <i>dernier ressort</i>,"
said Molly; "but this is much better.
Of course, Cecil, you and I have only one thing
to say&mdash;we think the scheme first-rate. Let us
write to Miss Forester in time to catch the mail
for London."</p>

<p>"The snow is nearly over; we may as well go
back now," said Cecil. "We need not wait for
Maurice. But oh, there he is&mdash;and how fast he
is running! What can be the matter?"</p>

<p>"I say, girls, what do you think?" exclaimed
Maurice, rushing up to the two as he spoke, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
laughing heartily. "I found that charming
Irish Kitty <i>tête-à-tête</i> with Mr. Danvers. There
was the old boy, with his hair redder than I have
ever seen it, pushed up like a brush from his
forehead, his eyes sparkling, his glasses stuck
awry on his nose, gesticulating and arguing and
scolding Kate O'Connor at the top of his voice.
He said that she was a disgrace to any English
school; that no boy of ordinary capacities would
construe so shamefully; that her quantities were
false, her accent vile; that, in short, as a lad of
spirit, she ought to give up murdering poor
Homer in the future. And there stood Kate in
front of him, arguing also, and defending herself.
You never heard such a noise as the two
were making in all your life. We four lads
burst in on the scene, and the fact of our presence
woke Mr. Danvers up. He got out of the
room somehow, without so much as looking at
Kate. When he reached the street, he mopped
his forehead and said to me: 'Tell me, Maurice,&mdash;for
really, in the confusion of the moment,
and the cruelty of seeing one of the finest passages
in Homer absolutely riddled through with
errors, I can't be certain of what I said,&mdash;but did
I speak to that young person as if she were a
boy?'</p>

<p>"'You certainly did, sir,' I replied.</p>

<p>"'Merciful Heavens!' he answered; 'I have
a respect for ladies. I respect them <i>in the distance</i>.
It is unworthy and ungentlemanly of
any man to be rude to a lady; but when a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
woman puts herself out of her place, when she
wounds a scholar, even a humble scholar, in his
tenderest sensibilities&mdash;&mdash; Maurice; my lad, the
air of this place is not what it was. I doubt
that St. Jude's will agree with me. Can you get
me a time-table?'</p>

<p>"'Nothing of the kind,' I answered. 'You've
come here now, and you shall stay. There's
another girl of our party,&mdash;Iphigenia, you'll compare
her to,&mdash;she shall read a passage of Homer
translated into better and purer English than
any fellow at Hazlewick could attempt. Now,
look here, sir; you've come and you must stay!
Jimmy and Charlie and Teddy, come along here
this minute!'</p>

<p>"I got them to surround him, Cecil," continued
Maurice; "so there is no fear of his
escaping; and now do hurry home."</p>

<p>They all set off at a quick pace, and Matilda,
icy cold, was able to creep out of her hiding-place.
She was very white when she did so, and
was trembling a good bit. She had had a narrow
escape of a very unpleasant adventure, and at
first all her feelings were simply those of congratulation.
After a time, however, as her
frozen blood began to circulate once more in her
veins, other thoughts came to visit her.</p>

<p>"So Kate is not to know," she said to herself.
"Kate is to be educated on charity. The peasant
girl, who is truly now a pauper, and whom I
cordially hate, is to receive the bounty of a complete
stranger, and to know nothing about it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
Perhaps I can put a spoke into that delightful
little arrangement. I must work cautiously. I
hate Kate, I hate Cecil! I have no special love for
Molly; my turn has come, I fancy, to pay off
some old scores."</p>

<p>Matilda hurried back to the house. She
crept softly upstairs, reached her bedroom without
anyone seeing her, and came down to early
dinner looking subdued and dull.</p>

<p>"Did you enjoy your walk?" asked Kate, as
she helped her to some soup.</p>

<p>"It was so cold that I did not care to go out,"
said Matilda, without a moment's hesitation.</p>

<p>"And did you really spend the last couple
of hours in your room! You must be simply
frozen."</p>

<p>"I did not wish to disturb you and Mr.
Danvers," said Matilda, with one of her sly
looks.</p>

<p>Kate burst into a fit of laughter.</p>

<p>"Oh, my dears," she said, turning to the rest
of the party, "I never had such a completely
jolly time in the whole course of my life; the
awful way that little man did rate me! 'You
are a young scoundrel, sir!' he said. 'How dare
you profane your lips with the words of the
greatest scholar, the most magnificent intellect
of all time, when your gross ignorance&mdash;&mdash;' Oh,
but I need not go on, I was annihilated, simply
annihilated, and I could not stop him. He kept
on glaring at me, and assuring me that I was
worthy of being expelled from any boys' school<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
in the kingdom. It was a relief when Maurice
came in. But oh, how funny he was, and how
thoroughly I like him, notwithstanding the fact
that I never was so scolded before in the whole
course of my life!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII.<br />

<small>A LOST LETTER.</small></h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-i.jpg" width="60" height="60" alt="I" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi">IT is a trite saying that the powers of
evil help those who are on their side.
That night, by a misadventure, Cecil
dropped the letter which Miss Forester
had written to her. By a more cruel misadventure
Matilda picked it up. Cecil and Molly had
both written to Miss Forester; their letters had
reached the post in time to catch the London
mail. Their minds were quite light and happy
on the subject. To make all safe, Cecil intended
to destroy Miss Forester's letter before she went
to bed that night. Kate's bedroom was on the
drawing-room floor, but Matilda, Molly, and
Cecil slept on the floor above. Cecil carried her
portfolio under her arm; it was packed with
letters, slips of paper, and small documents of
all kind. Miss Forester's letter, among others,
had been crowded into this overfull receptacle;
it slipped out, no one knew how. Quick as
thought, Matilda put her foot on it. Cecil did
not notice the circumstance. Matilda slipped
the letter into her pocket, reached her bedroom,
and danced about.</div>

<p>"Now I have it," she said to herself; "now I
am safe; no one can accuse me now of having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
eavesdropped. I am safe; I know exactly what
to do in the future."</p>

<p>She went to bed, hugging the precious letter in
her hand; she slept with it under her pillow,
put it away in a locked drawer early the next
morning, and came down to breakfast in high
spirits. When she entered the room, she heard
Cecil mentioning the fact that she missed a
letter.</p>

<p>"I must have dropped it last night," she said.
"I have searched everywhere for it."</p>

<p>"Whose letter is it?" asked Molly, looking
up innocently.</p>

<p>"It is one Miss Forester wrote to me."</p>

<p>"Oh, have you heard from Miss Forester?"
inquired Kate. "Is there any news? Did she
say anything about me?"</p>

<p>"She hopes you are getting better," said Cecil
calmly. "She is very anxious that we should
work specially hard next term."</p>

<p>"I hope she will allow me to work," said
Kate. "I am sure I long for it with all my heart
and soul. After what Mr. Danvers said yesterday,
I suppose I ought to give up classics."</p>

<p>"Nothing of the kind," interrupted Maurice.
"Cecil, will you give me a cup of coffee? Old
Danvers scolds everyone about their classics,"
he continued. "He is the best loved and most
feared master in the whole of our school. He is
a splendid chap; but Homer is his red rag; he
worships Homer to such an extent that it is like
touching a raw spot if, in translating the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
Greek hero, you make the slightest mistake.
Danvers is a wonderful linguist. By the way,
do you know Irish, Kate?"</p>

<p>"A little," replied Kate.</p>

<p>"Well, you talk to him about the Celts, if ever
you have an opportunity; just open out to him
on the subjects you do know a lot about. He'll
forget that you are a girl in less than three
minutes, and then he'll become perfectly delightful.
Cecil, what in the world are you frowning
about?"</p>

<p>"I am fretting about my letter," said Cecil.
"I can't imagine where it has got to. Did you
happen to see it, Matilda?"</p>

<p>"I saw you carrying up a lot of letters last
night," said Matilda.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, to be sure, and you were just behind
me. I didn't drop a letter by any chance,
did I?"</p>

<p>"Not that I know of," replied Matilda calmly.</p>

<p>"Well, you certainly would have seen it if I
had."</p>

<p>"I probably should. Will you pass me the
toast, Molly; and the marmalade, Jimmy? You
might have dropped it without my seeing it, of
course, Cecil. If I had seen it, I'd have naturally
given it back to you."</p>

<p>"Yes, of course you would. Well, I must
have a good search for it."</p>

<p>"You know you tore up a lot of letters, and
put them in the waste-paper basket," said Molly.</p>

<p>"Yes, but not Miss Forester's. I thought I'd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
read that once again before I consigned it to the
flames."</p>

<p>"We'll have a good search for it after breakfast,"
said Molly.</p>

<p>They did; they all joined in the search; even
Kate, who was never to know the contents of
that important letter; even Matilda, who knew
exactly where she could put her hand on it.
But, search high and low, inquire as they would,
they could not find it, and finally Cecil had to
yield to Molly's oft-repeated idea that she had,
without knowing it, burnt it, with a lot of other
waste paper, the night before.</p>

<p>"I suppose I did," said Cecil, with a sigh.
"It seems the only solution of the mystery, but
I never knew that I was subject to such a complete
lapse of memory."</p>

<p>"Well, come out now, and let us forget all
about it," said Maurice. "The day is sunshine
itself, and we can go for a real good long walk,
and I'll get Danvers to follow us. We'll make
for those caves where the skeletons are. Danvers
is mad on the subject of skeletons. We'll
all meet there, and I'll undertake that, after five
minutes' time, he'll absolutely forget that there
are any girls in the party."</p>

<p>"Kitty you must come out to-day," said Cecil.
"You are not even to look at that blessed
Homer of yours; you must spend the entire day
until dark in the open air."</p>

<p>"I am more than willing," replied Kate, with
a laugh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span></p>

<p>"Are you coming, Matty?" asked Molly.</p>

<p>"I suppose I had better; can't we go into the
town, though? I don't care a bit for caves nor
skeletons. I shall probably dream of the skeletons
to-night."</p>

<p>"Minority must yield to majority," said Kate,
with a laughing glance at Matilda.</p>

<p>Matilda colored.</p>

<p>"You shall pay for this, my beauty," she said,
under her breath. "All right," she remarked,
in a gentle tone, aloud. "I had better go and get
ready then."</p>

<p>She slipped out of the room as she spoke.</p>

<p>"How mild and good she is getting!" said
Kate, with a laugh.</p>

<p>"Too good," interrupted Cecil. "When that
sort of girl turns good, one has to look out for
storms."</p>

<p>"You'd better set me on her," said Jimmy.</p>

<p>"For shame!" cried Molly. "I think it is
mean to doubt anyone when they are trying to
behave properly. Matilda has certainly not been
nearly so troublesome as we expected; for my
part, I don't mind her being here a bit."</p>

<p>"Do just see if Molly's wings are sprouting,
Jimmy," cried Kate.</p>

<p>The whole party started off soon for their walk
to the caves. They had gone about a mile when
Matilda declared that her feet hurt her, that her
chilblains were worse than ever, and that she
wished to go home. As none of the others
particularly valued her society, she was allowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
to depart without any strenuous opposition.
She soon reached her room, took out Miss Forester's
letter, and read it, for the third or fourth
time, with a feeling of keen satisfaction. Before
she had read the letter she had been in possession
of its most salient facts; now her one object
was to convey the news which she had acquired
to Kate. Her difficulty lay in the fact that if
she breathed a syllable of what she knew, she
would be immediately accused of having again
stooped to the petty crime of eavesdropping.
Kate must certainly learn the contents of the
letter, but in such a way that Matilda should not
appear at all in the matter.</p>

<p>"Kate must find the letter," thought Matilda,
as she sat with it on her lap, and put her brains
in soak, as she expressed it. "Kate must not
only find the letter, but she must find it in such
a way, and under such circumstances, that she
will be tempted to read the contents. Now, if I
know Kate O'Connor aright, she is one of those
dreadfully scrupulous, honorable people who
would not read another person's letter for the
world. If she finds the letter lying snug and
neat in its envelope she will never glance at it;
she will return it to Cecil, and all my little
endeavors for her enlightenment on a certain
important subject will be thrown away. Kate
must not only find the letter, but she must read
it. Now, how shall I manage?"</p>

<p>Matilda thought and thought; the riddle she
had to solve was a somewhat difficult one. How<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
was she to put the letter in Kate's way? and
how was she to induce Kate to read it when she
found it? After careful thought, a scheme
occurred to her on which she resolved to act.
Molly Lavender was under the impression that
the lost letter had really been destroyed the
night before by Cecil. Matilda determined to
follow up this idea. The letter, when found,
should be torn and slightly burned; the inscription
should be gone; but the most salient point,
the words which specially alluded to Kate, should
stand out in startling distinctness. Kate should
find the charred letter, should pick it up; the
hastily divided parts could easily be put together.
Matilda should come into the room at the critical
moment, see the letter, pounce upon it, and read
aloud some of the most startling sentences before
Kate could stop her. The wicked girl laid her
plans with care; she took the envelope off Miss
Forester's letter and burned it. She tore the
letter then into three parts, slightly singed the
edges with a lighted candle, and slipped them
under the fender in the drawing room. Her
intention was to push the fender aside and disclose
the letter when only Kate was in the room.
Having laid her little bombshell with extreme
care, she became cheerful and happy. By the
time the others had returned she was dressed in
her most becoming frock, and danced out to
meet them in high good-humor.</p>

<p>"Well, I hope you have had a jolly day," she
said. "Do let us have charades or something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
lively to-night. I have been as dull as ditch-water
all the afternoon; but if we have a gay
evening, I shall go to bed feeling well and jolly.
Let us have charades after tea; they will help to
pass the long evening."</p>

<p>"A capital idea," said Maurice, "and Mr.
Danvers acts splendidly. What do you say,
Cecil? shall we get up something?"</p>

<p>"I am quite agreeable," said Cecil; "but who
will act?"</p>

<p>"I will if you like," said Molly.</p>

<p>"And I won't," said Kate. "I have walked
too much, and my head aches."</p>

<p>"We had better divide ourselves into two
parties," said Matilda, "one to look on and the
other to act; then each will have a turn at both
sides of the game. Oh, come, Kate, you must
act when it is your party's turn."</p>

<p>The young people all sat together, and arranged
their plans for the evening, while Maurice ran
off to beg Mr. Danvers not to fail them. As the
little man had absolutely forgotten that he had
not spent the entire day with a party of schoolboys,
he willingly agreed, and came in just after
the supper was cleared away.</p>

<p>"Kate's room must act as the greenroom,"
exclaimed Cecil; "it opens into the drawing
room, and will do splendidly. We must do
without curtains or anything of that sort."</p>

<p>The hastily got up charades were acted with
much spirit. At last there came the moment
which Matilda had anxiously planned and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
watched for, when she and Kate found themselves
alone in the drawing room.</p>

<p>"How dull the fire is!" said Matilda, going to
the hearth. "Oh, I know! the bottom of the grate
is choked up with ashes. I'll clear them out."</p>

<p>"No, don't!" said Kate; "it will make such a
dust."</p>

<p>"I must clear the grate," exclaimed Matilda,
"or we shall all perish with cold. Help me,
Kate; just pull that fender aside. I want to
make the hearth look tidy."</p>

<p>Kate did so, and the burned letter appeared in
view. She knew Miss Forester's writing, and
her color changed.</p>

<p>"Why, there's the letter which Cecil has
missed!" she cried. "It was burned, but not
wholly. Just let me throw it into the flames."</p>

<p>"Hurrah, Miss Forester's letter!" cried
Matilda. "Oh, I say! it's all about you, Kate
O'Connor. Here, see what she says:</p>

<p>"'I, of course, trust you girls not to say a
word about this scheme to Kate; she must on no
account know that she is penniless. Mrs. Percival
will pay all her school fees, and when she
has passed creditably through Redgarth, I will
then myself acquaint her with the truth. For
all reasons I think it wisest to keep the knowledge
from her at the present moment.'"</p>

<p>"Don't read any more," said Kate; her face
was like a sheet.</p>

<p>Matilda glanced at her with wide open, innocent
eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span></p>

<p>"Throw that letter into the fire," said Kate;
"you had no right to read it to me. Throw it
in; be quick! Why don't you do what you are
told?"</p>

<p>"Yes, of course," said Matilda; "but <i>how</i>
queer! So you are to be a charity girl, after
all."</p>

<p>"Hush," said Kate; "hush!"</p>

<p>She snatched the letter from Matilda's hands,
and flung it into the blaze; the flames licked it
up quickly; the writing disappeared, and Kate
turned round with a ready laugh and roses on
her cheeks to greet the young actors who at that
moment bustled into the room.</p>

<p>"Does she really mind, after all?" thought
Matilda to herself, as she watched her.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV.<br />

<small>GOD'S WILL AND KATE'S WILL.</small></h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-t.jpg" width="59" height="58" alt="T" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi2">THE next day the weather completely
changed; the wind came from the
southwest, the rain poured in torrents.
The great cold had gone, but the fierce
gale grew fiercer hour by hour. The girls and
boys appeared in the breakfast room with blank,
disappointed faces.</div>

<p>"What are we to do with ourselves all day?"
said Molly.</p>

<p>"I am glad I have my novel," muttered
Matilda.</p>

<p>"For my part, I wish the holidays had come
to an end," said Cecil. "I am wild to get to
work again. What do you say, Kate? Suppose
we do a little work this morning. I can help you
with your Homer, if you like."</p>

<p>"No, thanks," answered Kate; "I am not in
the humor to work."</p>

<p>"Have you a headache?" asked Cecil, looking
at her anxiously.</p>

<p>"No, I'm all right; but I don't care to work."</p>

<p>She went to the window and drummed her
fingers against one of the panes of glass as she
spoke.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span></p>

<p>"Aren't you coming, Kitty?" called Molly,
in her pleasant voice.</p>

<p>Kate turned slowly and seated herself at the
breakfast-table. Her face was very white, and
there were black shadows round her eyes.</p>

<p>"I say, Kitty, you don't look a bit like yourself,"
said Jimmy, giving her one of his particularly
keen glances.</p>

<p>"I am really quite well," answered Kate; "I
mean to go out for a long walk after breakfast."</p>

<p>"What, in this rain?" exclaimed all the
others.</p>

<p>"You forget that an Irish girl never fears the
rain."</p>

<p>"It does rain always in Ireland, doesn't it?"
asked Charlie, in an impertinent voice.</p>

<p>"Always, except when it is fine," replied
Kate calmly. "Pass me the toast, please,
Jimmy. Yes, I am going out. I enjoy walking
in the rain; I love, beyond all things, watching
a great gale of wind."</p>

<p>"Well, I won't go with you," said Cecil.</p>

<p>"I will," said Maurice, "if I may."</p>

<p>"No, thanks, Maurice; don't think me disobliging,
but I would really rather go alone,"
said Kate.</p>

<p>She ran into her room, and presently returned
in her waterproof cloak and hat.</p>

<p>"If I am not in to dinner, don't wait for me,"
she said to the others.</p>

<p>As she was running downstairs, she met
Matilda.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span></p>

<p>"I wouldn't fret if I were you," said Matilda,
glancing at her.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" said Kate, pulling
herself up short.</p>

<p>"Why," continued Matilda, "if you are a
charity girl, you also are&mdash;&mdash; I have been
thinking it over all night, and I have made up
mind that I won't tell; that is, if you will make
it worth my while."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" asked Kate.</p>

<p>"Why, this," said Matilda; "I notice that
you have great influence in the school. I can't
understand it; no one seems to mind your low
origin a bit; they seem rather to like you for
having been a peasant girl. Well, now, if you
will chum with me, and appear as if you
enjoyed my society, other people will perhaps
think me worth cultivating. If you approach
me in a friendly spirit next term, and talk of
me as your friend, why, I'll keep your secret.
There! is it a bargain!"</p>

<p>"You can tell every single person in the school
what you know about me," said Kate. "That's
my only answer. Now, let me go."</p>

<p>She pushed Matilda aside almost roughly, and
ran downstairs. A moment later she was in the
little street. The gale caught her waterproof
cloak, and swept her dress round her legs; it
played hide and seek with her hat, and dashed
great drops of rain into her eyes; as to her
umbrella, she could not hold it up for two
minutes. Walking up the street, she had to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
encounter the full blast of the gale. She,
struggled on bravely, glad of the physical
exertion which made her forget a very real pain
in her breast.</p>

<p>"Now, where are you off to, you young
scoundrel?" said a voice in her ear.</p>

<p>She looked up to encounter the keen blue
eyes of Mr. Danvers.</p>

<p>"I forgot; I beg your pardon!" said the
master, turning red. "I really thought for a
moment that you were Jimmy. But what are
you out for? this is no day for women to be
abroad."</p>

<p>"I like being out in the rain and wet," said
Kate.</p>

<p>"Well, don't go too near the shore; it positively
isn't safe."</p>

<p>Kate laughed in reply.</p>

<p>"I am accustomed to watching the sea in a
gale," she answered.</p>

<p>She hurried off.</p>

<p>"What is the matter with that girl?" thought
the schoolmaster to himself; "she has a queer
look in her eyes. She is a fine girl; yes, I'd
consider her a fine specimen of young woman-hood
if she didn't murder Homer in the way she
does; but something has put her out. What is
the matter with her?"</p>

<p>Kate, meanwhile, continued her stormy walk.
By and by she reached the shore; the tide was
out at present, but it was just beginning to turn.
A wide expanse of wet sand and low-lying rocks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
lay to her left; to her right rose the high cliffs
for which the place was famous. Kate hesitated
for a moment which way to turn. At last she
determined to go straight to the caves; the tide
was well out, and there was not the slightest
danger. She could go as far as one of the caves,
take shelter there, watch the gale without being
blown away herself, and think out the question
which was tearing her proud heart to pieces.</p>

<p>To reach the caves she had to walk with the
wind full in her face; the temptation, therefore,
to go the other way and be blown along by the
fierce gale was overpowering for a moment or
two; she determined to resist it, and made for
the caves. To reach them she had to walk a good
deal over a mile. These caves could only be
reached quite at low water, and the way to them
lay on the soft, yielding sand. Kate found, as
she struggled along, that she was by no means so
strong as she used to be when she had lived in
the cottage at home. In those happy days she
had never known fatigue. To fight with nature,
as she was now doing, only brought out her
splendid physical powers; she rejoiced in the old
days in conquering wind and weather. Her
dangerous illness had weakened her far more than
she had any idea of, and her legs trembled as she
hurried forward. She was so spent when she
reached the first cave that she literally could not
walk another yard; she entered it, and sat down
to rest. Out of the gale she had suddenly entered
into a perfect haven of calm. The cave was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
deep one; it went back far into the rock. At its
farthest extremity was a shelf, on which lay two
skeletons in a fair state of preservation. These
skeletons had been found in the clay some years
ago, and were left undisturbed in their resting
place; the angry sea often nearly touched them,
but not quite. At high tide, the rest of the cave
was generally under water, but the sea had never
yet been known to reach the spot where the
skeletons of a woman and child, who may have
died thousands of years ago, were still in a state
of preservation. People from far and near used
to come to see these relics of the past, but Kate
had never visited the caves before. She sat now
in the entrance, drawing a big stone forward and
making a temporary seat of it. From here she
could watch the angry sea, and even take pleasure
in the wild sight which met her eyes. She was
too tired at first even to think, but after a time
she became more rested. She took off her hat,
arranged her storm-tossed hair, twisted it up
afresh, and drew it out of her eyes. She held
her hat in her lap&mdash;it was soaked through; the
rain had even penetrated her waterproof cloak;
her stockings and shoes were sopping.</p>

<p>"I have got to fight a devil," she said suddenly
aloud. "There is a demon here,"&mdash;pressing her
hand to her breast,&mdash;"and he must be conquered,
or he'll conquer me. I shall fight him here in
this cave, and either he or I must die in the encounter.
If he wins the victory, the noble part
of me will have died, and I shall go straight to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
Redgarth and tell Miss Forester that I can't&mdash;I
never will&mdash;accept her charity. If he dies, why,
then, <i>then</i>, I shall return to the lodgings to-day,
to the society of Molly and Cecil and the boys, a
broken-hearted girl. Oh, I know beforehand that
I shall not conquer in this fight. But here, alone
with nature, the thing must be reasoned out.
Now, then, to begin."</p>

<p>Kate clasped her hands round her knees and
looked straight out at the angry sea; the waves
were already mountains high; the spray was
dashing straight into the cave and wetting her
face; the tide had well turned now, and the sea
was coming up in splendor. Kate never thought
of this. It would take a very long time before
the tide reached the cave, and meanwhile she had
her battle to fight. There were few girls prouder
than Kate O'Connor. Her pride had a great
many noble elements in it; it scorned deceit and
humbug of all kinds. She was not a scrap
ashamed of those things which smaller-minded
girls would have tried to conceal, would have
smuggled out of sight, and buried deep in their
own hearts.</p>

<p>The fact that her grandfather was poor, that
her own early life had been spent in a small cottage
by the sea, that she had not been waited on
by servants, nor worn fine clothes, nor done the
ordinary things of the ordinary young lady, never
caused her a moment's regret. When she arrived
at school she did not speak of her early life, not
because she feared to do so, but because she did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
not consider one of her companions worthy to
know the story of the beloved old grandfather,
and the grand poem which he had lived. Kate's
grandfather had been religious in the highest
sense of the word; he had lived very simply, and
according to the golden rule&mdash;he had done to
others as he would wish others to do to him; he
had thought well of his fellow-man; an unkind
and uncharitable sentence had never been heard
to pass his lips.</p>

<p>Kate had tried to live up to his standards but
whereas his religion had been tested in the fire of
a long life and many cruel circumstances which
his grandchild knew nothing about, hers was
simply the result of training, and had never been
tested at all. He had taught her a good deal,
and although she had never learned according to
modern ideas, she was in many respects a very
well-informed girl. Her imagination was of the
highest order; there was a strong dash of mysticism
and idealism in her character. In this
prosaic world, she herself was a living embodiment
of old romance; she delighted in poetry,
in nature; there was not a scrap of the worldly
spirit about her, but for all that she was proud.
To eat the bread of charity would be indeed gall
and wormwood to her. She thought, as she sat
now in the mouth of the cave and looked out on
the splendid scene which lay before her eyes,
that she would rather be the poorest servant in a
farmhouse at home than stoop to this.</p>

<p>"I can't do it!" she murmured; "it isn't in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
me. Grandfather left me money, not much, but
enough to have me properly educated. I can't
stoop to this. Miss Forester means well, but she
doesn't know me&mdash;or, yes, she does know me;
she knows that I, Kate O'Connor, poor, proud,
peasant girl that I am, would never consent to
this scheme; therefore she tries to hide it from
me. It is good of her, and yet it is not good.
It was Providence who put that letter in my way.
Oh, it was shown to me in an ugly manner!
Fancy my reading a letter which was not meant
for me! But I didn't read it; Matilda read it
aloud to me. How I detest Matilda! But if I
stoop to this thing&mdash;if I consent to become a
charity girl&mdash;I shall think myself almost at her
level. No, I shall refuse. I'll go back to Redgarth
to-morrow; I will tell Miss Forester the
simple truth. Perhaps I know enough now to
try and get a situation as nursery-governess to
little children. Anyhow, I can make an effort in
that direction. Oh, my dreams, my aspirations!
I thought to do so much, and perhaps some day
to write something lovely, and to make a name
for myself and for the dear old man who would
have been proud of me, were he alive. No, I
can't accept charity. I'm sure grandfather
would say I was right."</p>

<p>Kate paused here. In the midst of her wild
thoughts she remembered a certain evening when
she and the old man had been seated together,
and she had read aloud out of the Book of Books
to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Better is he that ruleth his spirit than he that
taketh a city,'" she had read. She was a child at
the time; she did not understand the words.</p>

<p>"What does that mean, grandad?" she had
said.</p>

<p>"It means that God loves the true conqueror,
child," he answered. "It is the greatest thing
in all the world for a man to rule his own spirit&mdash;so
to rule it that God's will may be his will."</p>

<p>"I think I know," she had answered vaguely.</p>

<p>She ran away then to feed her chickens, and
that ended the matter; but the verse returned to
her to-day.</p>

<p>"If to rule my spirit is to be willing to eat the
bread of charity&mdash;if that is God's will, then it
can never be mine," she said to herself.</p>

<p>A volume of spray dashed on her face and half-blinded
her. She rose, stretched herself, put on
her hat, and prepared to return to the lodgings.</p>

<p>"I shall go to Redgarth to-morrow morning,"
she said to herself. "I suppose I am conquered,
but I can't help myself. I never, never will eat
the bread of charity!"</p>

<p>She left the cave, and turned her face homeward.
She walked a dozen steps, then she stood
still. How long had she been in the cave?
What had happened? Surely the tide had come
up very fast. That long stretch of beach with
the headland at the farther end seemed, somehow,
wonderfully shortened.</p>

<p>"Impossible"&mdash;said Kate, with a thrill of
horror in her voice&mdash;"impossible that the water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
can already have reached the headland. Oh, no!
I am deceived by the distance, but I see that I
have no time to lose. I must run, or I shall be
shut in by the tide."</p>

<p>She ran fast, and the wind, which was now at
her back, helped her. She was a very swift runner,
and, notwithstanding the yielding nature of
the sands, she made rapid progress. With panting
breath and hair flying wildly under her hat,
she soon came up to the promontory which she
had to round in order to reach a place of safety.
At ten yards distant she stood still, clasping her
hands. She did not yet realize the danger of
her own position. Her eyes sparkled, and she
almost laughed at the majestic beauty of the
scene. The angry waves had already reached the
headland, and were dashing with bursts of magnificent
spray over the sharp rocks.</p>

<p>"I never, even in Ireland, saw such waves,"
said Kate to herself. "How glorious! Oh, that
I could write about them! They fill my heart;
such beauty as this <i>quite</i> satisfies me."</p>

<p>Then a thought, cold and dreadful, stole over
her delight.</p>

<p>"The way home is completely shut away!"
she cried.</p>

<p>The thought first stole into her brain, then it
crept down, down, until it reached her heart.</p>

<p>"Have I got to die here? Am I to be
drowned?" she said to herself. "I am only
seventeen, and I am full of life. Oh, is this the
way out of my dilemma? And I don't want to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
die. I am not a coward, no; but I don't want to
die, slowly and fearfully, and all alone, and with
this awful noise in my ears. To die by drowning
means suffocation. No, I don't want to die."</p>

<p>There was not a creature in sight. The towering
cliffs rose between her and safety. They
were rugged and straight, and impossible to
climb. The belt of sand on which she stood was
each moment getting narrower and narrower.
She made a careful calculation: at the present
rate of the in-coming tide, she had probably
about an hour and a half to live.</p>

<p>"I must go back to the cave," she said to herself.
"Perhaps, if I climb up on that ledge
where the skeletons are, I may find myself above
high-water mark. But I know the signs; I have
not lived close to the Atlantic all my life for
nothing. There will be a specially high tide
to-day."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV.<br />

<small>THE HEART OF THE GALE.</small></h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-w.jpg" width="59" height="59" alt="W" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi5">WHEN Matilda parted from Kate she
went up to her own room and stood
by the window. She saw Kate leave
the house and walk down the High
Street. She noticed how she battled with the
gale; she observed her when she paused to speak
for a moment to Mr. Danvers. Their conversation
was short. Kate continued her walk, and
Mr. Danvers came toward the house. Matilda
went then and stood opposite to her looking-glass.
She was a plain girl, but she was fond of
looking at her reflection in the glass. She looked
at it now with a sort of satisfaction.</div>

<p>"Yes, I am plain," she said aloud. "I must
admit, in the solitude of my room, that I have
not a good feature in my face. Kate is handsome;
Kate has got all that beauty about her
appearance which been denied to me. It will be
an interesting problem to see who will make the
best out of life&mdash;Kate, the pauper, the charity
girl, or I, who have more money than I know
what to do with, but who am not possessed of
beauty, nor of any special talent. I believe
I see my way now to having a good time at Redgarth.
Of course Kate won't dare to be anything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
but my friend now, for if she does I shall
hold this knowledge over her. Yes, I think I
contrived cleverly. I did nothing wrong. Oh, of
course not! I could not help overhearing what
Cecil and Molly said, and when Cecil dropped
the letter at my feet, I should have been more
than human if I had not picked it up. After all,
it would have been wicked to conceal this matter
from Kate. Poor Kate! how wild she looked
when she went out! Oh, yes, my beautiful Kate,
<i>I</i> know how to sting you! For all your false
humility you are about the proudest girl I know.
You proud! what right have you to be proud?
Oh, I shall love to humble you! You have got
neither birth nor money. There are some
tolerably poor people who are well born; I can
respect them&mdash;they have ancestors. I'd give
anything in all the world to have ancestors; but
Kate has nothing&mdash;nothing but her face, and her
slim figure, and something which people call
talent, in the back of her head. All right, Kate!
you shall eat humble pie now."</p>

<p>Matilda ran downstairs to the sitting room.
Cecil was bending over a book. Molly was
darning some holes in Maurice's stockings;
she delighted in helping Cecil with this work.
Mr. Danvers was standing by the window looking
out at the street, and the four boys were
occupying themselves in various ways in different
parts of the room. After a time, Mr.
Danvers turned slowly round and faced the
other occupants of the room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span></p>

<p>"That is a fine creature," he said; "whether
boy or girl. I repeat that the creature is fine.
I don't often pay compliments to the softer sex,
but I like that Irish girl. Now, can anyone in
this room tell me what is the matter with her?"</p>

<p>Cecil flung down her book, Molly stopped
darning, and all the pairs of eyes were fixed
on Mr. Danvers.</p>

<p>"Are you talking about Kitty?" asked
Charlie.</p>

<p>"Yes, boy, I am," replied Mr. Danvers. "I
am talking about the individual whom you all
call Kate. A fine unworldly creature, with a
dash of poetry about her. I believe I could even
teach her to respect Homer, if I had her under
my sway for a spell. But what's the matter
with her?"</p>

<p>"We didn't know there was anything the
matter," said Cecil. "Why do you ask?"</p>

<p>"Well, why isn't she in this room instead of
being drowned in an awful gale of this kind?"</p>

<p>"Oh, weather is a matter of indifference to
Kate!" answered Molly. "She is Irish, you
know. I think she was quite delighted at the
thought of going down to see the sea in a
storm."</p>

<p>"Well, I hope she'll come back soon,"
remarked Mr. Danvers. "It isn't safe for a girl
to be out in an awful gale of this kind, particularly
a girl with the look in her eyes which she
wore when I met her this morning."</p>

<p>"What sort of look?" asked Cecil, rising<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
from her seat and coming up to the little
man.</p>

<p>"A reckless, defiant, wretched look, which a
young thing ought never to wear," he replied.
"I am going out now to look for her. It isn't
often I see a woman worth putting myself out
about, but she's one. You can come with me,
Maurice, if you like."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, with pleasure," replied Maurice.</p>

<p>"And I," "And I," "And I!" cried the three
other boys. "You can't keep us back, Cecil;
we mean to go."</p>

<p>Cecil did not reply.</p>

<p>"Now that the men of the party have made
themselves scarce, perhaps we can read," she
said.</p>

<p>She resumed her book placidly; she was
evidently not in the least anxious about Kate.
Molly leaned back on her sofa and took up
her darning. Matilda went to the window.
It was strange that Matilda should be the only
one of the three girls who felt the least bit
uncomfortable, but such was the case. She, too,
had seen that startled, defiant look in Kate's
dark eyes. Perhaps there was danger down
by the shore. Certainly the gale was an awful
one. How the wind did shriek and scream!
How the rain rattled against the window panes!</p>

<p>"Of course I can't pretend to care for her,"
said Matilda to herself, "but I shall be a little
more comfortable when she comes home. I
should not like her to be knocked down or hurt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
in any way; I should feel that I had done it.
Oh, nonsense! what in the world am I thinking
about? That <i>I</i> had done it? What have I to
do with it? All the same, I'll be glad when she
comes back. Mr. Danvers said she looked in
trouble; well, yes, she did."</p>

<p>"Matilda, won't you sit down?" said Molly;
"you do fidget so by the window."</p>

<p>"I can't help fidgeting," said Matilda;
"there's such an awful gale on. Say, you two
girls, won't you be pleased when Kate comes
back?"</p>

<p>"Of course," said Cecil, looking up with an
expression of surprise; "but I didn't know that
you cared."</p>

<p>"You think I care for nothing," said
Matilda; "you have a hateful opinion of me."</p>

<p>"Sit down, Matty," said Molly, in a kind
voice. "Here's a cozy seat on the sofa, and
here is your novel, nice and handy."</p>

<p>"I can't read," said Matilda; "I am frightened.
I never heard such wind, and how dark
it is getting! What an awful day! I certainly
do hate the seaside in winter."</p>

<p>"No one asked you to come," said Cecil.
"If you won't read, perhaps you will stop
talking. Molly, I think I'll get Mr. Danvers
to go over this passage with me; I can't quite
get at the meaning of it. Do you think he will
mind?"</p>

<p>"No, of course he won't; he'll love to help
you," said Molly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span></p>

<p>"There's a flash of lightning," exclaimed
Matilda, covering her face with, her hands.
"Oh, how vivid! oh, I'm terrified of lightning!
What a clap of thunder! it almost shook the
house. Girls, it isn't safe for Kate to be out in
this storm, is it?"</p>

<p>Another flash of lightning came, even more
blinding than the first. Matilda crouched and
shivered. Cecil and Molly put down their
different occupations and walked to the windows.</p>

<p>"I do wish they were all in," said Cecil. "It
certainly is an awful day."</p>

<p>"Well, here they are, they're coming," said
Molly. "Don't you see Jimmy, how he rushes
down the street? and that's Charlie with him,
and there's Ted in the background."</p>

<p>A moment later the three younger boys dashed
into the room.</p>

<p>"I say, you girls," cried Jimmy, "there's
something awful up! Oh, we don't know what
it is! but Kate can't be found anywhere, and
Mr. Danvers and Maurice have gone on to the
coastguard station to get some of the coastguards
to help to look for her. There is an awful
gale down by the shore, and the tide will be several
feet higher than usual to-night, and she's
nowhere to be seen."</p>

<p>"I knew it!" cried Matilda; "I knew it, and
it is my fault!"</p>

<p>She fell down in a heap on the floor, and lay
there, with her face hidden.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span></p>

<p>The girls and the three boys, who were dripping
wet, stood and stared at her.</p>

<p>"Do speak!" said Cecil, catching Jimmy by
the shoulders and turning him toward her.
"Let Matilda alone. What did you say about
Kate?"</p>

<p>"That&mdash;that no one can find her. She's nowhere
along the shore," said Jimmy.</p>

<p>"But why should she be there at all?"</p>

<p>"She was there. An old fisherman saw her;
he saw her more than two hours ago. She was
going toward the caves where the skeletons are."</p>

<p>"Well," said Cecil, "well, speak! What is
it, Jimmy? What is the matter? You look&mdash;terrified."</p>

<p>"I am," said Jimmy; "I can't help it. It
takes a great deal to make a coward of me, but I
am a coward now. It is <i>Kitty</i>, you know, Cecil.
Cecil, they say the caves are completely covered;
the others say they must be full of water now,
and&mdash;and it's Kitty. If she's there, she's
drowned like a rat. Oh, I'm going to help!
I'll go back&mdash;I will help! Maurice and Mr.
Danvers sent me back, but I <i>will</i> help to find
her."</p>

<p>"I can't realize it," said poor Cecil, putting
her hand to her forehead. "What are Maurice
and Mr. Danvers doing?"</p>

<p>"They are going to take out a lifeboat to try
and reach the caves."</p>

<p>"But they'll be drowned, too," said Molly.</p>

<p>"As if they cared for that when there's a girl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
to save!" said Jimmy, in a tone of withering
scorn. "What are boys and men for but to save
plucky girls like Kitty? Oh, I say, I wish you
wouldn't make so much noise, Matilda!"</p>

<p>"Do get up, Matty, and stop crying and pulling
your hair about," said Molly.</p>

<p>Cecil did not speak, but her face was like a
sheet.</p>

<p>"It is my fault," said Matilda; "it is my
fault!"</p>

<p>"What in the world do you mean?"</p>

<p>Matilda sat up and stared round her. For the
first time in her whole life she was completely
natural; she absolutely forgot herself.</p>

<p>"I did it," she said; "I goaded her to it.
She'll never come home; she'll be drowned, and
I shall be haunted by her all the rest of my
days."</p>

<p>"Stop talking in that way, and tell us the
truth," said Cecil sternly. "What did you do?
Speak at once! Oh, what a mistake we made in
bringing you here!"</p>

<p>"You did; I wish I'd never come. I made
her nearly mad. I don't care who knows now.
Perhaps I wouldn't have been so bad if you
hadn't been so cruel and spiteful."</p>

<p>"I?" said Cecil.</p>

<p>"Yes, you&mdash;you hate me so! I wouldn't have
done it, perhaps, if only Molly had been here.
Molly really tries to be good."</p>

<p>"Tell us!" said Cecil. "Stop talking about
your motive. Speak&mdash;quick!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span></p>

<p>"I heard all that Miss Forester said the other
day about Kate."</p>

<p>"Then you eavesdropped again?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"When and where?"</p>

<p>"In the shelter down by the shore. I was
afraid the boys would bully me, and I crept into
the back part, where there was repairing going
on; and I pulled a tarpaulin over me, and no
one saw me. You and Molly came in, and you
read Miss Forester's letter aloud. I heard everything,
and I was delighted. I was glad that
Kate was to be humbled, and was to be only a
charity girl. You dropped the letter going upstairs.
I found it and put it in my pocket. I
was very anxious that Kate should know the
truth."</p>

<p>"You are a nice specimen of humanity," said
Cecil.</p>

<p>"Oh, do let her speak now, Cecil!" said
Molly.</p>

<p>"I don't care who knows," said Matilda.
"Oh, there's another awful flash of lightning!
I'm afraid I'll be struck; I'm not a bit fit to die.
Oh, yes, I'm sorry I've been such a bad girl!
You can't scold me, Cecil, more than I scold
myself. Oh, there's another flash! Oh, I shall
certainly be struck! Isn't it safest to go down
into a cellar or to get into a feather bed?"</p>

<p>"Do go on!" said Cecil.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm terrified! Oh, I know I'm a bad
girl! You can't hate me more than I hate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
myself. Oh, dear, do let me take off my watch,
and fling the keys out of my pocket! It isn't
safe in a storm to have any sort of metal about
you."</p>

<p>"<i>Will</i> you go on?" said Cecil.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes! I wanted Kate to know. You
thought you had burned the letter with some
other rubbish. I acted on that idea, and tore
the letter in two, and burned the edges, and
stuck the pieces under the fender here. Then
last night I pushed the fender aside, and Kate
saw the letter, and she recognized the writing,
and I snatched it up and read a passage aloud
before she could stop me. I read the part which
told her everything. She knew her money was
gone, and she was to be a charity girl. Oh, she
was mad, mad, and she must have gone out to
drown herself to-day! I expect she did. She's
horribly proud, though you think her good. It's
an awful sin on her part to be so proud. Why
should she mind being a charity girl, if she is
one? Oh, dear, oh, dear! another flash! That
lightning will strike me dead. Oh, girls! do
you think God will forgive me; do you think he
will?"</p>

<p>"I can't speak to you," said Cecil. "I am
going out."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI.<br />

<small>THE OPENING IN THE CLIFF.</small></h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-c.jpg" width="59" height="60" alt="C" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi2">CECIL walked toward the door; Molly
was following, when Matilda pulled
her back.</div>

<p>"You shan't leave me," she said,
flinging her arms round Molly's knees. "I won't
be left alone in this awful, terrible black storm.
You know how wicked I am, Molly, and that I
am not fit to die. You can't&mdash;you shan't leave
me! God will never forgive you if you do."</p>

<p>Molly hesitated for a minute; the thought of
her vow in the cathedral came back to her. She
longed to fly out after Cecil, but after all, she
could do nothing in the fearful gale, and
Matilda&mdash;wretched Matilda&mdash;really needed her
presence.</p>

<p>"All right; I will stay with you," she said.
She dropped down on the nearest chair and
covered her face with her hands.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Cecil, having slipped on her waterproof
cloak and tied a hat on her head, ran out
into the gale; the boys had long ago disappeared.</p>

<p>Cecil was a country-bred girl, but she had
never been out in such weather before. Her old
waterproof cloak was not very waterproof, after
all, and in the space of a few minutes she was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
literally wet through. The rain was running in
rivers down the little street, the puddles were
pools, the pools were ponds, the ponds were
small lakes.</p>

<p>"If this goes on, there will be a flood,"
thought Cecil. "How am I to get to the caves?
How am I to save Kate? Oh, what awful lightning!
It must be almost directly over our heads;
there is not a second between the flash and the
peal of thunder. Poor Kate, is she alive now?
Why did she go to the cave where the skeletons
are? We should have had none of this terrible
trouble but for Matilda. But why did Kate feel
it so much? Is Maurice's life to be sacrificed to
Kate? I must find Maurice; he mustn't go in
the lifeboat. No, no, he shan't! What shall I
do? How am I to reach the coastguard station,
in the teeth of such wind and rain as this?"</p>

<p>Cecil struggled on, every nerve strung to the
highest tension; every faculty and force in her
body stimulated to its greatest pitch to enable
her to win the day in this terrible battle with the
weather. She was buffeted and knocked about;
her hat was torn from her head; her hair was
loosened and flew wildly about her in the gale; she
was so wet, too, that her heavy garments clung
to her and impeded her progress. Suddenly, as
she ran, a thought occurred to her. To attempt
to put out to sea in such a gale as this was sheer
and utter madness. Such a storm had not been
known on the coast for many years. Cecil in all
her life had never encountered such weather. If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
Mr. Danvers and Maurice really persuaded the
coastguard people to launch the lifeboat, they
would only cause their own death, and the death
of the men who went with them.</p>

<p>"I must stop them," thought Cecil. "I would
do anything that human being could do to save
Kate, but she can't be saved that way. I know
what boys are in a moment of excitement; I
know that my boys, at least, have not a scrap of
fear in them. Thank God, they are not cowards!
and I'd give them, yes, I would, if there were
any chance of saving Kate, after all; but to know
that there isn't, and then to give them up&mdash;oh, I
can't do that! Stay, what have I heard? Is there
not some way of reaching the caves&mdash;some way
from the top of the cliff? What was that story
Jimmy told us one night about a smuggler who
hid treasures in the cave and hauled up his goods
by the cliff? I remember the night quite well,
and Jimmy's face, and how we begged and implored
of him to stop talking rubbish; but perhaps
there is something in it, after all. Oh, if I
can only reach the coastguard station before the
men have lowered the lifeboat!"</p>

<p>Cecil battled on desperately and bravely. For
some time she obtained partial shelter by means
of a high wall which guarded a certain part of
the road, but to reach the coastguard station she
had to cross a headland. There was not a scrap
of shelter here; nothing whatever to break the
fury of the wind, and the lashing, biting power
of the rain. To add to her discomforts, it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
turning bitterly cold, too; the rain was changing
into sleet, the great hailstones hit Cecil's cheeks,
lips, and forehead, causing her severe pain. She
shut her eyes for one desperate moment, and
almost gave up all hope of reaching her destination.</p>

<p>Suddenly the welcome sound of a human voice
reached her ears.</p>

<p>"You'd best not go on, miss," said the voice;
"the storm gets worse. Don't you venture nigh
to the edge of the cliff; it aint safe."</p>

<p>Cecil looked up; a big, burly Jack tar was
standing within an inch of her.</p>

<p>"I'm so glad I've met you," she said. "I
<i>must</i> get to the coastguard station, without a
moment's delay."</p>

<p>"Whatever for, miss?" said the man. "I
don't believe you can," he added, "the storm's
that fierce."</p>

<p>"I must," said Cecil; "it is a matter of life
or death. There is a young lady drowning in
one of the caves down by the sea, and my
brother and another gentleman have gone up to the
station to ask your men to lower the lifeboat."</p>

<p>"Whew!" said the sailor, drawing in his
breath and emitting a long whistle; "those that
go out to sea to-day do it with their eyes open.
Why, no boat, lifeboat or not, would live in this
gale half a minute, miss. Is it to help or hinder
you want to reach the station? I've not been
there for an hour or two. I say, miss, no lifeboat
ought to put out to sea to-day."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is to prevent it&mdash;to prevent it," said Cecil.
"It is because of my brother. I can't have him
drowned. Oh, be quick! can't you help me to
get to the station? He is so fearless, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Take my arm, miss," said the sailor.</p>

<p>He turned without a word, pulled Cecil's hand
through his arm, and, turning to face the gale,
walked quickly in the direction of the coastguard
station.</p>

<p>Cecil never remembered afterward how the end
of that walk was accomplished. They reached
the station just in time to see Mr. Danvers and
Maurice helping two or three sailors to get the
lifeboat out of its shed.</p>

<p>"You can't do it!" said Cecil, rushing down
into their midst; "it isn't safe; it only means
that several will be drowned instead of one."</p>

<p>"Then we must drown," said Maurice, with
set teeth. "We must take our chance; it is a
desperate thing, I know, but we can't stand here
and do nothing, and let a girl die like a rat in a
hole. I am surprised at you, Cecil!"</p>

<p>"Don't look at me like that, Maurice," said
Cecil. "I am desperate&mdash;I don't pretend to be
anything else. I'd let you go if there was any
use in it, but there isn't. No boat could live in
such a gale."</p>

<p>"You are right there, miss," said one of the
coastguard men. "We couldn't refuse the
gentlemen when they were so desperate earnest;
but such a gale hasn't been known on the coast
for the last twenty years."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span></p>

<p>"Come here, Jimmy," said Cecil suddenly.
"What was that story you told us about a
smuggler hiding goods in some of the caves?"</p>

<p>Jimmy, whose face was blanched with terror,
brightened up considerably at Cecil's words.</p>

<p>"What a goose I was to forget!" he said. "It
is true, isn't it, Evans?" he added, going up and
standing in front of one of the tall coastguard men.</p>

<p>"What is true, master?"</p>

<p>"That there's an opening at the top of the
cliff, which leads right down into one of the
caves&mdash;the cave where the skeletons are?"</p>

<p>"Well, I've never seen it, sir, but my grandfather
used to speak of it. It's my belief it's
closed up by now."</p>

<p>"Let us try and find it," said Cecil. "There
is not a vestige of hope of saving Kate by the
sea. Even if the lifeboat could live in such a
gale, she would be dashed to pieces on the rocks
by the caves. Let us go to the top of the cliff
and search for the opening."</p>

<p>"It is a sensible thought," said Mr. Danvers.
"I will go, anyhow. I hate giving up the lifeboat,
but I don't believe she would live for a
moment in this storm. The other idea has but a
glimmer of a chance, but we may as well try it.
Now, boys, start away. Evans, perhaps you
will come, too, and lend a hand."</p>

<p>"That I will, sir, and so will my mate,
Sharp."</p>

<p>"And I too, sir," said a coastguard man of
the name of Adams.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span></p>

<p>The little party was soon under way. They
held each other's hands, and in this manner were
able to struggle against the ever-increasing storm.
The coastguard men had provided themselves
with coils of rope and some grappling-irons to
fasten into the top of the cliff. The distance
from where they now stood to the cliff over the
caves was nearly a mile; but, after a fierce tussle
with wind and weather, they reached the spot;
and then their desperate and forlorn search for
the lost opening began.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII.<br />

<small>ROCK OF AGES.</small></h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-m.jpg" width="59" height="60" alt="M" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi3">MEANWHILE, Kate sat in the cave. She
was all alone. In front of her raged
the angry sea. She watched it at first
from the entrance to the cave. Step
by step, slowly but surely, she saw Death, the
grim foe, advancing to meet her. Kate had been
close to death a little earlier in the same year,
but then she had been unconscious. If Death
had really claimed her as his prey, she would
have gone away into the other world knowing
nothing of that last journey. In ignorance and
oblivion she would have passed the boundary,
and when she found herself in the Life beyond
this life, she would recall no memory of the
road by which she had come. To meet death by
severe illness would have been in the ordinary
course of nature, but the death which now
awaited her was different. She was well again,
and strong; she had recovered from her accident;
all her feelings were alive and keen; she was
young, too, and had nothing, in the ordinary
sense, to do with death; it was very awful to
Kate to see it coming up to her in this manner.</div>

<p>The very vividness of her imagination only
added to the horrors which she now endured.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
She was about to part from life, and life at this
moment became exceedingly precious to her.
The thought of the real suffering which she had
endured a few hours back, sitting in the entrance
of this very same cave, now seemed trivial and
of no account whatever. She had been a very
angry and passionate and rebellious girl. She
had thought her pride and independence honorable
and righteous, something to hug to her
heart, to cling to, whatever happened; now it
seemed but a paltry sort of rag, not worth a
moments thought nor a moment's pain. For
the sake of it, however, she was about really to
lose her life. Because she could not accept a
great kindness, because she would rather turn
her back on all her true friends than hear certain
silly words applied to her, she was to die.</p>

<p>"I was mad," thought Kate to herself.
"I see the thing in its right light now. My
proud heart could not brook the thing. Oh,
grandfather! you used to tell me many times
that I must conquer the pride which has been
my undoing. I was proud of my very openness
and humility; I was proud of telling the girls
what I really was, but this last indignity I could
not, I would not, submit to. I would not rule my
spirit in this matter!</p>

<p>"'Better is he that ruleth his spirit than he
that taketh a city.'</p>

<p>"I would not rule my spirit, and now God has
taken me at my word. I came out here to have a
fight with my own proud heart. I know that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
God was whispering to me all the time not to be
angry and impatient, not to throw away the
chances he was giving me. He wanted me to
cultivate my talents, and he showed me this way,
which was hard to take, and bitter; but it was
his way, and he wanted me to take it. Oh, I was
mad! I refused&mdash;I gave the devil the victory, and
God was angry, and now he is punishing me.
God has taken me at my word. I shall never eat
the bread of charity. No one will ever call me
a charity girl now. God is taking away the life
which I would not use as he wanted me to use it.
Oh, I never thought I should fear death! How
beautiful grandfather looked when he died! but
he was ready, and I am not. I am young. How
full of life I feel! how my heart bounds! how
keen and strong my brain has got once again!
but in a few minutes, perhaps an hour, it will all
be over; my brain will have no more thoughts;
my heart will be quiet. I shall be dead&mdash;drowned!</p>

<p>"I wonder how people feel when they are
drowning. I have read accounts of drowning
people, and they say that, just before they go,
they see all the old life, that it passes before
them as a sort of vision. I wonder if grandfather
knows that I shall be with him to-day. Perhaps
I am not good enough to see him. I am so sorry
to die. O God, is it possible that you can forgive
me even yet, and let me use my life now in
your way, and not my own way? Oh, I don't
want to die!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span></p>

<p>Kate crept a little farther into the cave. The
great storm of nature was raging magnificently
outside. Flashes of lightning were filling the
cave with a lurid light from moment to moment.
The thunder rolled and echoed. But Kate
scarcely noticed the storm. Her whole mind,
every nerve, every scrap of feeling she possessed,
became soon absorbed in watching the water.
She had no fear of the lightning striking her, but
she dreaded the ever-rising tide inexpressibly.
In a short time it reached the entrance to the
cave&mdash;the next wave rolled in, washing the sandy
floor. Kate started back in fear. She moved
inch by inch farther and farther into the recesses
of the cave; soon she was standing almost in the
dark. The waves echoed with a horrible hollow
sound as they entered the cave; they seemed to
dance and play with one another.</p>

<p>The storm of thunder and lightning was gradually
dying away, but now and then a flash still
lit up the cave; and cast a reflection, like momentary
fire, on the crests of the rolling billows.
Kate's agony and terror grew worse and worse.
She found herself at last at the extreme end of
the narrow cave. She climbed a shelf of rock,
and took refuge where the skeletons of the long-dead
woman and child were lying in their clay
bed; she felt the clay, and found it hard and dry.
As a rule, therefore, the water did not reach this
point. But Kate was well aware that this was a
flood-tide, which, helped by the terrific gale,
would reach a far higher spot than that usually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
gained by the waters. She clasped her hands,
clung to the side of the rock, closed her eyes, and
endeavored to pray.</p>

<p>"I will try and be resigned," thought the poor
girl to herself. "I will try not to be angry and
impatient; I will try hard to turn my thoughts
from the world. I deserve this punishment.
God was very good to me, and I would not have
his goodness; now he is taking me away. Oh,
I will try to be patient, and not to be a coward!
I will try to meet my death calmly. Oh, if only
it were all over&mdash;the shock&mdash;the suffocation&mdash;the
struggle for breath! Suppose I fling myself into
the water and get it over at once. No, I won't
do that; perhaps I may be able to hold on; perhaps
the tide will not reach such a high point,
after all, and if I stand up here, and cling tight
to the rock, the water may really turn before I
am drowned.</p>

<p>"Oh, I wish I were ready to go! I wish I had
thought of the things of the other world a little
more when I was well and strong. Grandad used
to say so much about being ready to die. He
used to say that it put everything into a right
focus, and then this world never looked too big
nor important, and there was no room in the
heart for foolish, silly pride, nor any other merely
<i>worldly</i> sins. Grandad was ready; I wish I
were. Oh, it is awful to be drowned like this in
the dark! I wish there was some higher shelf on
the rock that I could grasp and cling to: I wish
I were not so frightened. There, that is the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
wave; it has touched my feet, it has washed just
over the shelf where I am standing. How bitterly
cold the water feels, and how strong! but the
rock is stronger. I will cling to the side of the
rock with both my hands. What is that hymn&mdash;'Rock
of Ages'? Grandad and I used to sing it
on Sunday evenings: 'Rock of Ages, cleft for
me.' I will shut my eyes and try to think of the
old hymn.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"'While I draw this fleeting breath,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When mine eyelids close in death.'</span><br />
</div>

<p>"Yes; 'when mine eyelids close in death.'"
It will soon be all over now. I shall see grandad,
and I think, <i>somehow</i>, God will forgive me.
Poor Kate! yes, grandfather used often to call me
'Poor Kate.' He said I had a stormy nature;
he said he was the same when he was young, but
he conquered himself. Poor Kate! I didn't
conquer it, and now I am going.</p>

<p>"'Rock of Ages, cleft for me.' I am not so
frightened since I have thought about the Rock
of Ages. Yes, the water is very cold; icy cold.
It is up to my knees now; how fast it is coming
in! 'Rock of Ages.' I'll shut my eyes and try
to think of the hymn."</p>

<p>"Kate!" called a voice; "Kate!"</p>

<p>It sounded, muffled, and from a long way off,
but no clarion note from the clearest trumpet
could have made a more complete revolution in
all Kate O'Connor's feelings. When she heard
it she roused herself on the instant from a state<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
of stupor into one of vigorous action. She had
thought herself almost in the other world, but
once again now she was keen to battle for her
life.</p>

<p>"Kate!" called the voice. It sounded like
Cecil's, only very, very far away. "Are you
there? Answer me; shout up, if you are&mdash;say
yes."</p>

<p>"Yes!" called Kate.</p>

<p>She was no longer weak&mdash;her voice had gone
from her with a shout. Her vigorous "yes"
was answered by a faint cheer, which seemed to
come from miles away.</p>

<p>"Kate," called the same voice again, "there is
a rope coming down to you&mdash;a stout rope; tie it
firmly round your waist when it comes, and we'll
pull you up. A rope will be with you in a
minute."</p>

<p>"Be quick!" called Kate.</p>

<p>She had scarcely said the words before something
dangled against her face; it was a thick
rope weighted with lead. Here was her last
chance. With vigorous, frantic haste she tied it
securely round her waist.</p>

<p>"Say when you are ready," cried the voice
from above.</p>

<p>Kate gave the rope another pull.</p>

<p>"Ready!" she called.</p>

<p>The next instant she found herself lifted gently
off her feet. Up and up, through the narrow
passage in the cliff, she was drawn; up, and up,
and up, until at last, bruised and shaken, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
still alive, she saw once again the glad, the
beautiful, light of day. No matter that the elements
raged and the winds blew, and the very
earth seemed to shake&mdash;it was still the glad old
earth; Kate was alive, and death was far away.
It seemed too good to be true.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>They all brought Kate O'Connor back in
triumph; she was petted, and soothed, and
kissed, and made much of. Even Matilda rushed
to her and flung her arms round her neck, and
burst into tears over her, and Kate, wonderful to
say, did not repulse her. Then she had a hot
bath and was put to bed, and she closed her eyes
and dropped to sleep, while Cecil and Molly
watched her, too excited and too rejoiced to
leave her even for a moment. When she awoke
from that sound sleep, she was none the worse
for her terrible adventure.</p>

<p>"Molly and Cecil, I want to say something,"
said Kate, clasping both their hands in hers.
"God saved me from drowning almost through
a miracle; and I am so glad to be alive again,
Molly, and so delighted to be able to kiss you,
Cecil, and this bed is so delicious, and your dear
faces are so lovely, and the earth is such a grand,
splendid battlefield, and it is such a <i>good</i> thing
to be young and strong, that if every girl at Redgarth
taunts me with the fact that I eat the
bread of charity, I shall not mind them now.
For I think, there, in that awful gale, God
showed me, himself, a way to rule my spirit. So,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
girls, I am going to forgive Matilda, and I'm
going openly and frankly to accept Miss
Forester's offer; and if I repent of it by and by,
and have to fight my battles over again, you
will promise to remind me of what I've said just
now."</p>

<p>"Oh, I think you are grand!" said Molly.
"I think you've the best pride after all&mdash;the
right pride.".</p>

<p>"Kiss me!" said Cecil.</p>
